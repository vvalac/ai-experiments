{"page_content": "Beginners Guide to Crafting ### Beginners Guide to Crafting Crafting in Asheron's Call 2 is much different than many other multiplayer games out there. In AC2 it takes alot of patience and many many hours of grinding to keep up with your character level. Finding a Craft suited to you is very important due to its income potential at higher levels. What is better making an item yourself and spending a small amount of gold or spending large amounts of gold to someone else to make the item for you? You could also be the one making the large amounts off others in the process! Lets start with the basics. First lets make our first set of tools. Open your skills window and click the far right tab. This should open up your Craft section and give you a list of all the different types of items you can be proficent at. Scroll down to the bottom and you will see Tools listed click the arrow next to Tools and open its sub menu. Tools * Resource Tools * Crafting Tools * Starter Tools * Practice Recipes * Building Materials * Lodestones From this section we want to click on the arrow next to Starter Tools. A list of various tools are listed select each one and open your examination window by pressing the \"X\" button. Each will give you a brief discription of what it is used for. These tools only have a durability of 50 once created and will self destruct once the number reaches 0. These tools also require no resources to make. Once we gain a few levels using one of these tools we will want to get new ones of higher quality from the Resources Tools or Crafting Tools sections of this list. Thes upgraded tools do require resources to make so be sure to look at them to find out what items are needed. Lets select and make a Crude Hunting Knife aswell as a Crude Hatchet. both of these items I will go over their individual useage in one of the two following links. Butchering (use of a Hunting Knife) Mining (use of Hatchets, Chisels, Pickaxes, Mattocks and Rock Hammers) The two above links go over collecting the items needed to create most of the crafted items for your character. In the beginning most crafts only need one specific resource type or a combination of two but as your skill increases more and more item types are required and in larger quantities. For this reason it is safe to assume that you will need to keep your tool making skills on par with whatever craft you will be working on. We will now go over making your first item in your prefered craft. As a crafter you can focus on one given line of skill, you do not have to become a Spellbinder, Armorsmith or Weaponsmith. If you wish you can be a Toolmaker, Butcher, Miner or a Refiner. Its all about what you want to put your own time into. For the sake of argument we will use a single craft skill that you can mold your own given craft around. For this example I will use Armor: Lugian. Open Armor: Lugian in your Craft window then select Kilts, you will see four types listed. Open your examine window by pressing \"X\" on your keyboard then select Scout Kilt as you can see in the examine window in the bottom text it has a Difficulty 1(L1) - 300(L100) rating. Now click on the Skirmishers Kilt its rating is 55(L15) - 310(L100). What does this mean? Basicly at skill level 1 in this given craft you will only be able to make the Scout Kilt and will not be able to successfuly make your first Skirmishers Kilt until skill level 15. Lets go to the Scouts Kilt window by pressing its icon or double clicking on Scouts Kilt in the listing. The Ingrdients list should have opened. As you can see there is a empty box with the text 13 Iron beside it and below that you will see the text Item level and a up and down arrow with a Box with the number 1 in it. Click the up arrow four times. As you increase the Item level the number of Iron needed increases also once you hit Item level 4 at the top the words \"Scout Kilt\" changes color. This color change tells the success chance at making a given item at a given skill level. As a note you want to make the White andYellow colored items as they will help you advance with the minimal risk of losing resources. * Green - 100% (No chance at failing but gives no Craft XP bonus) * Blue - 90% to 100% success rate. * White - 70% to 90% success rate. * Yellow - 50% to 70% success rate. * Red - 30% to 50% success rate. * Purple - 10% to 30% (Highest chance of failing) * Gray - Less than 10% (grayed out and can't be attempted) Drag your iron into the Empty box inside the Ingredients window or you can use the auto-fill ability that is on the lower left hand side of the crafting box. This is nice to use for us crafters who keep our crafting materials in various bags, then press the \"craft\" button located at the bottom of the window. If successful you have just created your first Scout Kilt. Now we want to look at the Craft Skills window, If you still have the Kilts section open that is fine if not then just select any skill section you will notice at the bottom three lines of text. Current Level, Avail. Craft XP, and Cost to Raise. As you make more items your Current Level will increase. Craft XP is bonus experience that can be applied across all your skills but I recomend that you do not use it until your higher levels of a given skill. Cost to Raise is how much experience is needed to advance to the next Level in that given skill, this number will decrease as the more items in that skill you make. Hopefully this has helped you. -David/Skinlab Misc Info: Corrections and Additions by: Hinhan * Navigate AC2Hero * Home * Crafting * Quests * Guides * Items * Maps * Search * News * Related Links * turbine.com * asheronscall.com * ac2wiki.info * ac2crafters.com * * * * * * * * * * Feedback * Terms of Use * About Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings (C) 2004-2013 Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. /// Copyright (C) 2013 AC2Hero.com", "metadata": {"source": "http://ac2hero.e5i5o.com/begining.html", "title": "AC2Hero", "description": "Asheron's Call 2 Hero is the most complete source for Asheron's Call 2(2013).

{"page_content": "Crafting: Surveying and Mining ### Surveying and Mining. Surveying and Mining go hand in hand, the better we are at both skill the higher potiential gains from a resource. This is due to a bonus for a high Surveying skill, which maxes out at 40 extra yield units per swing at 150 Surveying. The Mining Skills need to be raised individually, but raising Surveying will help all Mining Skills at once. Open the Surveying Skills tab and select the Osteth Maps section. As you can see there are alot of different types to mine but you can only do one map at a time. If you cash in a map you will have to wait five minutes before you can make another unless you have successfully gathered from a mine. Set your Lifestone possition close by to a Cartographer this will make it easy to knock out maps back to back. Give the Map to a Cartomancer they will send you directly within the area of your resource map. As soon as you zone in, double click the map in your pack and open your mini- map and set it to follow your possition. By double clicking the map before you move anywhere it sets the initial possition that is needed to locate your resource. In my personal opinion looking at my compass and mini-map help me locate the resource based on the text given. Choose a direct North, South, East or West direction and when needed to change to go in another direction make it a direct path aswell North, South, East or West. By doing so it eliminates the chance of straying off course and will help you locate a resource much quicker. If you pay attention to your map each time you double click your resource map it will place a small marker on your main map. This marker is color coded based on how close or how far you are from the target.Litte diamonds appear on the map with each click. They are color coded, and can help you figure out where you need to go. Red Diamond - Too Far Orange Diamond \\- Not to Far Yellow Diamond \\- Close Green Diamond \\- Very close Also by reading what the map tells you will give you hints on what direction to take. #### Surveying Directions. First part of message | Approximate distance You're outside the borders of the map | In this case if you are currently searching and used a cartographer return to the spot he sent you else go find one. You are somewhere within the map's borders | 2-3 full compasses away You're not too far from the map's destination | 1-2 full compasses away You're close to the map's destination | Over half the diameter of a compass away You're very close to the map's destination | Within one half of a compass distance Second part of message | Direction You make note of your location so that you can measure your progress | The start point - go in any which way and you feel you're headed in the right direction | keep going ahead and you're sure you're going the right way | keep going ahead and you're making rapid progress | keep going ahead and you're about as close as you were before | turn 90 degrees (quarter turn) but you feel you're headed in the wrong direction | turn 180 degrees (one half turn) Step 1 : Double-click (use) the map to get the starting location. If it says \"somewhere ...\" or \"not too far ...\", then its safe to move a few coordinate clicks (1 click = 0.1 radar unit) Step 2 : Move at least 0.2 radar units in one of the cardinal directions and use the map again, ie East, West, North or South. If it says \"but you're sure/you feel you are going the wrong way\", then turn 180 degrees and start again in the opposite direction Step 3 : Use the map again, hopefully the second part of the message will say we are moving in the right direction Step 4 : Keep moving in the same direction, until we get the message ending with \"and you're about as far as last time you checked.\" Step 5 : Turn 90 degrees and repeat from Step 2 Step 6 : Repeat until we get the message \"You are very close\" Step 7 : Now we are only 0.3 units away in any one of the 3 directions we have not been yet (straight ahead, to our left or to our right) **Misc.

{"page_content": "News \ufeffHero Update #31 **Date:** 2013-11-10 As previously mentioned in a prior update Images have been added to the Dyes section, thanks to -Dr Brain- for his contributions. Over 40+ quests XP values have been updated to the beta 4 values. Many thanks to -Grudge- for working on the number crunching and validation of the XP. At current the Layout changeover and Beta 4 updates are at around 98% complete. Enjoy! * * * Hero Update #30 **Date:** 2013-11-08 Fixed a few bugs that presented themselves from the layout update. The total site change is about 95% complete and should be completed over the next few days. Some of the changes I am working on will allow me to build on some of the areas such as Items in a more fluid way. Hope everyone likes the new ac2h. Enjoy! * * * Hero Update #29 **Date:** 2013-11-02 Currently implementing the new website layout. Certain areas of the website may be unavailable during this process. If an area is unavailable please check back in a few minutes. * * * Hero Update #28 **Date:** 2013-10-30 Currently working on some new features and a new layout for the website while also doing my best to get the quests XP values updated from the last patch. I also have some armor dye images which were recently donated that will be posted. * * * Beta Update #4 **Date:** 2013-10-21 Made corrections to several NPCs locations in the database. Updated the Coords in eight-teen of the affected quests. 6 new NPCs added. Currently working on updating the XP, portal and ringway locations, NPC locations and the various other quest related changes released in #4. If anyone has found any changes I have missed feel free to send me an e-mail. * * * Beta Update #3 - Preview **Date:** 2013-07-05 As per forum posts about the next patch which was slated for June, it has been pushed back sometime after the July 4th holiday. A preliminary list of things to come in the next patch as posted by NoWorries: 1\\. The majority of quests have had their XP rewards increased (this goes for all level ranges). Some quests have also had their level ranges adjusted slightly as well. 2\\. Incursions have been standardized to once a day quests. 3\\. More Armoredillos and Green Wasps have been added to Arwic to help with completing the kill tasks there. 4\\. The Miller of Kehan now gives a recipe for a map and teleports the player near to the maps destination to give a more accurate intro to surveying. 5\\. The Esper Warder has had some dialog adjustments to make the steps of the quest more clear. 6\\. The Warder of Cragstone now gives both the Cragstone Excavation and Find the Warder Corporal quest at the same time. - With the Cragstone Excavation quest being a group challenge, we wanted to give players who couldn't get the quest finished guidance on where to continue their journey so they wouldn't hit a big roadblock on what to do next. 7\\. The Warder Corporal has been moved into Rithwic and now gives both the Isle of Tears and Find the Warder Scout quest at the same time. 8\\. The Warder Scout has been moved to Molwirth, along with the Drudge Fort, to give more exposure to another town. 9\\. The items for the Broth of Tanacha quest have been increased in frequency. The start of the quest has been moved to north of Rithwic so players are exposed to it at the same time they begin killing the creatures necessary to complete the quest. 10\\. Portals, and some NPCs, have been moved around in the Osteth towns to make the experience more intuitive and easier to navigate. 11\\. Pluck the Stray Darkenfowl has become Pluck the Darkenfowl and now starts at the Omishan drop spot. All Darkenfowl now count toward the kill task. 12\\. Cleanse the Burial Mound items drop more frequently. 13\\. Reaper Madness Horns(Reaper Madness), Banderling Badges(Banderling Trounce P2)and Mire Wasp Stingers(Mystic Rituals) also drop more frequently. * * * Hero Update #27 **Date:** 2013-06-30 After an extensive battle vs. the Chinese and Russian spam botters over the last few months. We had no other course but to move away from the out-dated forum version the server host provided to a more updated version. Sadly the members database for it could not be rolled over tot this new version, we do encourage you to re-sign up if you had an account previously. More sections have been added as well as more features. Thank you for your support and understanding. I have also been working through the walk- through images and updating them with higher resolution versions. Several Quests have been updated, thanks to Guimas for pointing the errors out. As always ... Enjoy! * * * Hero Update #26 **Date:** 2013-06-16 After a month plus of working on this side project, I have now released the Skill Calculator, it still has a few quirks but the values in it are pretty solid, Thanks to Project Pyreal and BlackSunshineTJ for giving me a hand with coordinating the matching of skills to tables, as well to the seven people who supplied their XP trees, getting this calculator to this point could not have happened without you guys! Most of the remaining issues with the calculator will be addressed as time allows. But, the calculator now works across Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Chrome. Enjoy!! * * * Hero Update #25 **Date:** 2013-06-08 !!!! I need your help! Please send me your skill tree info! (Skill Name - Skill Level - XP needed to raise) also include your Race. Send this Info to support@ac2hero.com. This information will allow me to complete this massive project to bring you a fully working up to date Skill Calculator. The scripting is almost complete but I can not release it until I get alot more info from you guys!!!! * * * Hero Update #24 **Date:** 2013-06-03 Now with 99% of the known quests listed, I can begin the process of improving other areas of the site. Such as, reworking the Items section, Adding more information to the crafting section, building some leveling guides. Getting a Skill Calculator operational that works across the top four browsers(Could use some help from JavaScript guru's). Another thing I am thinking about doing is adding a comments section to many of the pages here, this will allow you to point out things I've missed, or to help others find what they are looking for. If at anytime you find a issue with a quest, such as not being able to get the quest at its posted level, or anything that could be better explained let me know. I will get those changes done as fast as possible. * * * Hero Update #23 **Date:** 2013-05-23 Finally in the home stretch to completing the vast list of quests. Aside from the Knorr quests i am down to single digits for Omishan and Linvak. 20 Quest have been added over the last week. The site has now officially surpassed ac2vault's number of quest walkthroughs by over a hundred. I decided to remove the flip images section that was once above this news section after viewing it across 5 different browsers it just seemed a bit to much. I am still in need of the Hero Titles from the Empyrean classes Heiromancer and Mentalist who are aligned with a Kingdom, this will allow me to finish up a new table for the site. If anyone out there is willing to write up a good Class Guide(Any Class) I'd like to post it. I would still love to have a few people lend a hand in helping me find and correct errors Krelleon has definitely helped me out a lot lately finding a few so I want to say Kudos to him for lending me his sharp eyes. * * * Hero Update #22 **Date:** 2013-05-13 For Update #22, I have alot for you, 24 quests added since last update, website layout redone, reworked the site search to get away from the google search which was just a temorary addition. There will be a screenshots section added as soon as you guys start sending me your leet-ness. I will also have a video section setup once I can find someone willing to do some video guides or if I can talk the kind people at turbine in to doing developer video-blogs. Much like the ones they do at wargaming.net, players know whats coming down the pipe way ahead of time. Though im sure this is something that wont happen very soon. I finished up the write-ups for Temple of Elemental Light, and Cleanse the Chaos Forge be sure to check those out. I will also be setting up a Allegiance of the Week, this will put a spot light on various Allegiances as the weeks go on. I removed the translator for the time being, but have plans on finding a way to integrate it again later on(maybe.. 98% of the visitors are en-us). There are still a few bugs that can only be done on the main server, and I will address them over the next coming days. I know the margin on the quest are up againt the left border, ill have to edit each individual page to square that away but I will have that fixed soon. The next phase of the site will be the completion of the quest write- ups, as a rough estimate 66 are left to finish. * * * Hero Update #21 **Date:** 2013-05-03 For Update #21 I had to do a little extra something for you guys. BAMM you now have a Site Search under the Search menu, had several people ask me for this feature, you now have it!. and BAMM you now have complete!! XP Charts, these were provided for you by Project Pyreal these can be found in the Guides menu. I also fixed the page the link below referenced. Added two more starters to Arramora's Incursions and updated a few more quests information. * * * Beta Update #2: Patch Info **Date:** 2013-05-02 I went and completed all the kill quest that were modified by the patch. this Link will take you to a page with all the updated values. Enjoy * * * Hero Update #20 **Date:** 2013-04-30 Busy busy busy, prepping for the release of the new longly awaited Beta Patch 2 that has been reconfirmed to release this Tuesday. In this past week 40 new Quests and the Arramora Exigencies have been added. Updated 10 other quests that lacked quest text. Project Pyreal has provided you guys with new Crafting Experience Tables, hopefully we will see more of their work here on the site soon. Again Guimas has provided more Dungeon Maps for you guys, make sure you thank him for all his hard work as much as I do!, Enjoy Everyone! * * * Beta Update #2: Patch Notes **Date:** 2013-04-25 For all you ready to see the new changes that will be made in the up coming patch Tolero made this post: So even though the tech folk are working on login issues, I didn't want to hold out on the release notes for much longer for the anticipated AC2 patch that got moved to next week. Click here for an early look at what's coming in Beta Update 2! * * * Beta Update #2: Patch Delayed **Date:** 2013-04-24 As per the AC2 Forums Severlin made the following post: Greetings. Our AC2 patch was delayed. We found some issues with our build process that caused problems with the build. We are working on those issues right now and hope to have the AC2 build out to you at the latest next Tuesday. Sev~ * * * Hero Update #19 **Date:** 2013-04-22 Took a break from playing and quest writing to finish some of the projects I have had on the back burner, NPCsearch is now live. After completing the script I went through each of the current quest write-ups and updated them with the content from this new feature. You will now be able to search for a given NPC and it will provide you there coords, location and all the quest they are involved with. While performing this task I also made some corrections to the various quests, made a slight adjustment to the visited link color so you can tell the pages you have already gone too. I also setup an email account just for submissions and corrections or to send me love letters Hahahah, support@ac2hero.com. I removed the Items sections from the menu that took you to under-construction pages they will be put back once the content is finished. Renamed Crafting Primer to Beginning Crafting in the Crafting menu as I think my military terms took over when I made that menu name. Updated the potions once more. Added 10 more quests since the last update posting. Guimas stepped up again and provided many new dungeon maps that have been missing, so a big Thanks! goes to him. and as always... Enjoy! * * * Hero Update #18 **Date:** 2013-04-16 Corrected Quest starter coords for Omishan-Darkstone quest. Corrected various QP numbers, thanks to Xendrane for the values. Changed the layout of the Quest and main page section of the site. Added 35 more quests to the listing over the past week. Added Vothardun, Chaos Eidolon, Chaos Plane - Spiral maps to the map section. Updated the Potions, Reckoning Gems item listings. Thanks goes to everyone who has given me input on improvements for the site. * * * Hero Update #17 **Date:** 2013-04-10 Added a few more quest since yesterday. Moved most of the old news to its own page. I am still not back home yet, on site at MACCDC, but should be back home later in the week. * * * Hero Update #16 **Date:** 2013-04-09 Currently still away from my home computer but plenty of time in hotels has given me the chance to do a few quest write-ups for you guys. A new quest series for a Deru Berl (Vigor regeneration increased by 25% buff) that starts with the quest Burun Interdiction, within the 18 quests added. Kudos to Grudge for his research on this * * * Hero Update #15 **Date:** 2013-04-01 Added Quite a few Knorr Wilds quests to the quest section. Added several maps the site was missing(special thanks to Guimas for allowing me to add them). This coming weekend I will be out of town, If you do a quest i do not have, save the info and post it in our forums(icons, NPC text, XP and times from quest would be awesome), you will get full credit for doing so. A huge thanks to Lost-Company Allegiance. for helping me these last few days. * * * Hero Update #14 **Date:** 2013-03-30 Added more quests to the listing, including those from Shoushi, more from Hakata, Arramora, Linvak. and a few more from Omishan. Updated the links in the Armor section. Added the Dillobell to the instruments section. * * * Hero Update #13 **Date:** 2013-03-23 So... I took the time and helped a few people that were not getting help in general chat on a few quest and it lead me in the direction of a few quest I have never seen before. So without further hesitation they have been added to the Quest listing in the mix with 30 more quests! Soon I will be able to finish up all the quests under level 50 and be able to focus on the 50+. I am sure a few of you are wondering \"where is this database with all this stuff in it\", to clarify.. it will go up once a few zones I have not been able to access yet can be, I also want to make sure the formatting will work with how I have things setup currently. All I can ask is patientence. * * * Hero Update #12 **Date:** 2013-03-13 New member of the team Spazmeister, who has released his first guide Art of Growing Plant Dyes. I also added the three Armor of the Ancients (Knights, Lords,Kings) quests and Shoyenan's Solutions, The Blood of Tyrants(pet tyrant) quest, The complete Olvidan Farm quest line from Pumping Iron to Dillo Rancher, and the Dillo Rustler(pet Dillo) quest. Enjoy! * * * Hero Update #11 **Date:** 2013-03-11 Added another 20+ Quests since the last update. I did some work on the Motes section(slowly getting rid of the Construction pages). Looking for a Videographer to make some How-To and Walkthroughs for the site. I am also still in need of a co-writer to help populate the quest write-ups. I am ideally looking for someone who knows how to use screenshot software, notepad, image editing software is a plus and who is also a systematic thinker. As i have stated on the AC2 forums even if i have to build this site alone I will continue to do so simply for the love of the game(though I am not sure you wanna hear my redneck voice in a how-to video, \"yawl, gotta go 'ere and fetch up dis thingy\"). I also updated a few more items on Essence table 1 and Essence table 2 for all you crafters. I may eventually move these updates to there own section for News so i can free up the front page for more specific game related info. * * * Hero Update #10 **Date:** 2013-03-06 Added another 16 Quests since the last News posting. Also did a tweek to all the pages you most likely will not even notice. As I have done before I worked out some uniformity issues across the pages. * * * Hero Update #9 **Date:** 2013-03-03 Added 18 more quest, with a mix of Osteth and Linvak Massif, Including the Hero Initiation quest, Soulbound Weapons for Osteth and Linvak. I finally hit hero on my main character to expect to see alot more in the coming weeks being I can finally get access to the other two continents. This will also allow me to finish up those databases you all been wondering when I would release... I promise they are on their way. Another side job for me will be to implement a way for you to see what Crafts what items are for, we will see how that goes and how the database will play a part with that. I am hoping to complete many more quest this weekend. * * * Hero Update #8 **Date:** 2013-02-27 Added 16 more quest walkthroughs, more of those unlisted anywhere. Added Dungeon Map section to Maps. I've slowly been building on to the bulk of commonly searched for information. Spread the word about ac2hero, and help this site grow. As always i'm still seeking more help from writers to help build on the growing quest walkthrough section. I am also seeking people who are know their class like the back of their hand that would be willing to provide Class Guides. Contact me in-game or through our forums. * * * Hero Update #7 **Date:** 2013-02-23 The past few days I have added over 30 quest walkthroughs, most of which have not been recorded anywhere else, So... ac2hero.com can say it was the first. I will be updating the essence tables once more shortly. * * * Hero Update #6 **Date:** 2013-02-18 Today I added a Spell Effects guide provided by Billy Mountain with his consent. I did some more consistency fixes and added six more quest guides. In my spare time I been running all around Dereth to gather coords for a future database that will house Landmarks, NPC, Lifestone, Town Centers, Outposts, Points of Interest, Dungeons and Portals this will allow you access to more information from the guides and walkthroughs. The Items section is still in the works I will most likely condense this section into its own database where you can select a given section or do a search for a given item, in my opinion it would make it easier for you to find what you are looking for.I will also be providing some updated Map content here in the coming weeks. I am hoping this will increase the usefulness of this site and provide expanded accurate data for everyone. The feedback I have so far received has been positive and the ones who have pointed out things they would like to see.. well.. its in the works :). Thank You again for your continued encouragement. * * * Hero Update #5 **Date:** 2013-02-13 OK guys major site update new paging system that will help make the new additions i have planned for the future easier to implement. I also added a new menu system that should be cross browser compatible. I added more data to the Crafting - Essence Table, Added Commands to the Guides section, moved the search section to its own menu item(this will be were the other database searches will end up too),removed the bright white in all the tables(I had complaints about it making it hard to read the data - so I fixed it :) ). I still need walk-through writers !!!!!, I know you're out there, Sign-up on the Forums and lets make this happen! * * * Hero Update #4 **Date:** 2013-02-10 I understand there was some issues setting up accounts on our forums, i do apologize for the problems. I have fixed the problem and accounts can now be created. I have also been working on the finishing touches to a Bestiary, I am hoping this will be available within the week. * * * Hero Update #3 **Date:** 2013-02-08 The Bestiary is now live, Fixed a few consistency issues across the pages, added links to bestiary across all quests and crafting areas. Reworked some style sheet issues and changed the link colors. Added some coords to several pages for cartographers and various other NPCs. A NPC database is in the works, as well as finishing up the Items listings. Slow and steady growth, would love to hear your feedback on the forums. * * * Hero Update #2 **Date:** 2013-01-13 Today i have added some more items to the Items Listing slowly but surely i will have the vast majority of them listed and i can start the next phase of the sites development. Which will be primarily the Quest and Guides so I can direct the Items to their perspective Quests. I am still in need of people to help out with the Quest Walkthroughs. So if you are willing sign up on our forums. * * * Hero Update #1 **Date:** 2013-01-09 Hopefully in the coming weeks this site will be fully up and running. I have been working to gather as much data as i can from in-game aswell as across the internet to put all the things a player needs to find into one location. As it stands most of the data around the internet right now is vastly out of date i am hoping this site will fill that void and bring you exact locations for quests, and up to date crafting solutions. I hope you all as fellow players will help me by bringing me your knowledge. Feel free to use the forums as a place you can call your own. I am currently searching for staff members to help me for more information go to our Forum post. For now know the site is still under construction so some links are not complete. * * * * Navigate AC2Hero * Home * Crafting * Quests * Guides * Items * Maps * Search * News * Related Links * turbine.com * asheronscall.com * ac2wiki.info * ac2crafters.com * * * * * * * * * * Feedback * Terms of Use * About Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings (C) 2004-2013 Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. /// Copyright (C) 2013 AC2Hero.com", "metadata": {"source": "http://ac2hero.e5i5o.com/news.html", "title": "AC2Hero", "description": "Asheron's Call 2 Hero is the most complete source for Asheron's Call 2(2013).

When I heard the waters of the lake were draining, I crept down here to the emerging ruins of Aretfon in hopes of discovering the entrance to the fabeled necropolis housing the tombs of the kings of old. However, our ancient enemies have proven too quick. While our backs were turned, they seized the ancient ruins and the treasures laying beneath them. I'm safely barricaded here, but I still must know whether the tombs of our Kings lie sacrosanct... find them and report their condition to me, and I will reward you with the recipe to create the Armor of the Ancient Kings.\"_ Find all 6 Tombs inside the Catacombs of Artefon(13.8N, 9.5E) on a small island in the Artefon basin, Located south of Simlan.

Simlan tells you, _\"Search for the correct materials and craft a set of the Armor of the Ancient Kings for yourself. Sontar Trisoya has discoverd the lost Emerald Mines of Ulkas in the mountatins between the Nepth Strata and the Stoeneshadow Plain. The Gurog of Linvak Massif still hoard their stores of Ebon Pyreal. Orlen Jarlns has found Shoyanen's lost method of imbuing emeralds near her old tower.\"_ Now you will need to obtain 19 Ebon Pyreals and 13 Emeralds. To obtain Ebon Pyreals these can be found on Gurogs and will spawn on the ground around the Malthabbor Ringway, west of Gurukora, the Thusik region, and around the Stoneshadow Central Outpost. For Emeralds you will need to head south of Ondekodo to the Emerald Mines(24.2S, 31.8W) drop down the ravine to get to the entrance. Hand Sontar Risoya an Ebon Pyreal to enter the mines. Remember you need 13 Emeralds which is all you will be allowed to mine anyway from the quest Sontar Risoya gives you. In most cases you may need a group to help clear the mine in this case you will need a Ebon Pyreal for each of those members to enter the Mine or they will bring their own. A note: If you open your Skills window, Crafting tab, scroll down to Quest Recipes you will see a section called Mines of Ulkas, inside you once you have given the pyreal, Click the Mine Emerald recipe. Select the mine and use the recipe to do the mining for you. This will allow multiple fellowship members to mine at the same time. Mining by just clicking on the mine will prevent you from mining if someone else is already in the process of doing so | Ebon Pyreal | 1 to enter mine, 18 needed to make the armor, + one for each person to help in the mines not doing the quest | Emerald | 13 needed to make the armor. You will need a Shadow Totem and Aconite for the next part of the quest, Shadow Totems are found from random drops or you can possibly find one in the Curiosities Shop in Cragstone or other major city. Aconite can be found in the Kydi Delta Region on the ground or purchased from a Curiosities Shop in one of the major cities. | Shadow Totem | 1 needed to give to Orlen Jarlns for Shoyanen's Solution Quest | Aconite | You will need a minimum of 5 maximum of 7 of these plants for the Shoyanen's Solution Quest, Once you have the Emeralds and the Shadow Totem you will need to make your way to Mayoi. Once you are in Mayoi travel southeast to Orlen Jarlns (5.7S 49.2E). Orlen Jarln tells you, _\"Greetings stranger. My former research led me here to the famed tower of Shoyanen Kenchu. Through my excavation near this tower I discovered her lost recipes for the infusions which allowed Master Smith Ulkas to imbue the gems of his Armor of the Ancients with magic beyond compare. As my scholarly focus includes many subjects, I also believe the objects within the Hoard of Chaos deserve further research. I am now willing to make an exchange - bring me a Shadow Totem, and I will give you my Alembic, instruct you in its use, and show you how to imbue the jewles from the Ulkas mines with power.\"_ You will need to hand him a Shadow Totem key to start the Shoyanen's Solutions quest. Orlen Jarln tells you, _\"Thank you! There has been a small amount of geothermal activity in the lesser isles of western Ariaki, eastern Lumari, and the Mist Curl Vale of Oriad. Fill up this Alembic with Mineral Water from one of the Geysers that have sprung up in each of these areas. Combine the Aconite flowers that grow here in the Kydi Delta and the Ariaki River Delta with this Mineral Water into an infusion and give it to me for inspection. I will then show you how to imbue jewels from the Ulkas mines with magic. Keep in mind that the water flowing from each of these regions is subtly different, and when combined with Aconite will yeild a different type of infusion.\"_ Orlen Jarln gives you a Glass Alembic which will be used to collect the waters for the solution | Glass Alembic Travel to the Mist Curl Geyser(23.7S, 1.7E) southeast of Whitebay to get the Waters of Mist Curl Vale. Hand the Alembic in your inventory to the Mist Curl Geyser to get Waters of Mist Curl Vale. | Waters of Mist Curl Vale Use the quest recipe to create a Decoction of Aconite. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. You will need to repeat this process until you have 14 Suspension of Aconite. | Decoction of Aconite | 14 Suspension of Aconite are needed(13 for the emeralds, and 1 to complete the Shoyanen's Solution quest). Once you have all 14 return to Orlen Jarlns(5.7S 49.2E) southeast of Mayoi. Hand him one Decoction of Aconite to complete the Shoyanen's Solution quest. He will then give you the recipe needed to imbue the Emeralds. Each Emerald will need to be imbued with one Decoction of Aconite. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. Use the recipe to create 13 Imbued Emeralds Orlen Jarlns tells you, _\"Good job! I shall reserve this infusion for my future research, but take this recipe. I hear the fabled emerald mines of Ulkas have been discovered by a man named Sontar Risoya in the ravine south of Ondekodo. This recipe will help you imbue the emeralds from these mines with magical properties that have been lost to the world until now. Good luck in your travels, adventurer.\"_ | Imbued Emerald You will now be able to create your armor with the combination of the 13 Imbued Emeralds and the 18 Ebon Pyreals by using the recipes given to you.

Discover them for me and I will reward you with the knowledge to create a set of armor of great knowledge.\"_ You will now have to find the 6 tombs of each Knight along the western shore of the Lake Artefon basin. Tomb of the Knight Dragon at 16.6N, 4.7E Tomb of the Knight Flame at 17.8N, 6.4E Tomb of the Knight Shield at 19.3N, 4.9E Tomb of the Zharalim at 20.5N, 6.9E Tomb of a Knight of the Unicorn at 20.5N, 5.3E Tomb of the Prophet of Blades at 19.6N, 6.4E | After double clicking on each of the tombs, the quest info should update each time. Return and speak to Tima Drokh (14.3N, 3.3E) near Molwirth. Tima Drokh tells you, _\"It is as I feared--the tombs have been desecrated and thier contents have been removed, Who could have done such a thing, and why? The Warders of Osteth must be notified. Thank you for your diligence. In my research of the city I uncovered the ancient means to create the armor of the Ancients Knights, which I will now grant to you. I've Heard that Ilia Grayten recently announced her discovery of the lost Ruby Mines once owned by the great Master Smith Ulkas. Word of her discovery came from the west, at the base of the Cobalt Mountians. She might be able to help you find the jewels you need to complete your armor. Another acquaintance, Orlen Jarlns, has found Shoyanen's lost method of imbuing rubies. He is now living near her old tower.\"_ Now you will need to obtain 13 Ferrous Pyreals and 8 rubies To obtain Ferrous Pyreals the easiest way to do this is head to the Fetter Mounds north of Southern Prosper Outpost the Ferrous Pyreal spawn randomly within the circular looking area on your map, another way is to kill Inferno Drudges within the Firey Crypt which is much harder at lower levels.For Rubies You can do this one of two ways. You can locate and kill the Undead Knights that hang around near the tomb areas, who drop 1 ruby each, or you can go to the Ruby Mines. To get to the Ruby Mines you will need one Ferrous Pyreal to give to Ilia Grayton (16.6N, 4.6W) near Molwirth. Give her the Ferrous Pyreal and enter the mines. There are 3 mines that you can mine from. Remember you need 8 Rubies which is all you will be allowed to mine anyway from the quest Ilia Grayten gives you. In most cases you may need a group or a high level player to join you to help clear the mine in this case you will need a Ferrous Pyreal for each of those members to enter the Mine. A note: If you open your Skills window, Crafting tab, scroll down to Quest Recipes you will see a section called Mines of Ulkas, inside you once you have given the pyreal, Click the Mine Emerald recipe. Select the mine and use the recipe to do the mining for you. This will allow multiple fellowship members to mine at the same time. Mining by just clicking on the mine will prevent you from mining if someone else is already in the process of doing so | Ferrous Pyreal | 1 to enter mine, 12 needed to make the armor, + one for each person to help in the mines not doing the quest | Ruby | 8 needed to make the armor. You will need a Shadow Totem and Aconite for the next part of the quest, Shadow Totems are found from random drops or you can possibly find one in the Curiosities Shop in Cragstone or other major city. Aconite can be found in the Kydi Delta Region on the ground or purchased from a Curiosities Shop in one of the major cities. | Shadow Totem | 1 needed to give to Orlen Jarlns for Shoyanen's Solution Quest | Aconite | You will need a minimum of 5 maximum of 7 of these plants for the Shoyanen's Solution Quest, Once you have the Rubies and the Shadow Totem you will need to make your way to Mayoi in Omishan there is a portal to Omishan in Cavendo located at (16.2N, 29.1E) once in Omishan head west you will see the ringway icon on your map, follow the ringway until you reach Mayoi. Once you are in Mayoi travel southeast to Orlen Jarlns (5.7S 49.2E). Orlen Jarln tells you, _\"Greetings stranger. My former research led me here to the famed tower of Shoyanen Kenchu. Through my excavation near this tower I discovered her lost recipes for the infusions which allowed Master Smith Ulkas to imbue the gems of his Armor of the Ancients with magic beyond compare. As my scholarly focus includes many subjects, I also believe the objects within the Hoard of Chaos deserve further research. I am now willing to make an exchange - bring me a Shadow Totem, and I will give you my Alembic, instruct you in its use, and show you how to imbue the jewles from the Ulkas mines with power.\"_ You will need to hand him a Shadow Totem key to start the Shoyanen's Solutions quest. Orlen Jarln tells you, _\"Thank you! There has been a small amount of geothermal activity in the lesser isles of western Ariaki, eastern Lumari, and the Mist Curl Vale of Oriad. Fill up this Alembic with Mineral Water from one of the Geysers that have sprung up in each of these areas. Combine the Aconite flowers that grow here in the Kydi Delta and the Ariaki River Delta with this Mineral Water into an infusion and give it to me for inspection. I will then show you how to imbue jewels from the Ulkas mines with magic. Keep in mind that the water flowing from each of these regions is subtly different, and when combined with Aconite will yeild a different type of infusion.\"_ Orlen Jarln gives you a Glass Alembic which will be used to collect the waters for the solution | Glass Alembic Travel to the Atolu Geyser(22.6N, 48.4E) in the Ariaki region to get Waters of Atolu. You can reach this area from Orlen Jarln's location by travelling back to Mayoi and taking the Gateway to Ikeras(4.5S, 44.5E), once you have traveled through the gateway travel east towards the city of Ikeras. you will see the Ariaki Ringway(9.5N, 61.2E) just past the Lifestone. Travel the Ringway to Northwest Ariaki Outpost(17.1N, 48.5E) once here travel north, you will see an island off the coast that will be your destination. Once on the island make your way to the Atolu Geyser (22.6N, 48.4E). Hand the Alembic in your inventory to the Atolu Geyser to get Waters of Atolu. | Waters of Atolu Use the quest recipe to create a Decoction of Aconite. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. You will need to repeat this process until you have 9 Decoction of Aconite. | Decoction of Aconite | 9 Decoction of Aconite are needed(8 for the rubies, and 1 to complete the Shoyanen's Solution quest). Once you have all 9 return to Orlen Jarlns(5.7S 49.2E) southeast of Mayoi. Hand him one Decoction of Aconite to complete the Shoyanen's Solution quest. He will then give you the recipe needed to imbue the Rubies. Each Ruby will need to be imbued with one Decoction of Aconite. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. Use the recipe to create 8 Imbued Rubies Orlen Jarlns tells you, _\"Good job! I shall reserve this infusion for my future research, but take this recipe. I hear the fabled ruby mines of Ulkas have been discovered by a woman named Ilia Grayten in the Cobalt Mountains. This recipe will help you imbue the rubies from these mines with magical properties that have been lost to the world until now. Good luck in your travels, adventurer.\"_ | Imbued Ruby You will now be able to create your armor with the combination of the 8 Imbued Rubies and the 12 Ferrous Pyreals by using the recipes given to you. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. Once you have created all five pieces the quest will complete and you will recive your experience and quest points. | Boots of the Ancient Knights | Armor Rating: 7 Combat Delay: 10 Effect: Reflection (Reflects a portion of damage back on attacker) Requirements: Level 20+ | Brestplate of the Ancient Knights | Armor Rating: 24 Combat Delay: 10 Effect: Incombustability (Increases your resistance to damage received through Fire attacks) Requirements: Level 20+ | Gloves of the Ancient Knights | Armor Rating: 7 Combat Delay: 10 Effect: Absorbtion (Increases your Melee, Magic, and Missile Defense) Requirements: Level 20+ | Greaves of the Ancient Knights | Armor Rating: 12 Combat Delay: 10 Effect: Antivenom (Increases your resistance to damage received through Poison attacks) Requirements: Level 20+ | Helm of the Ancient Knights | Armor Rating: 7 Combat Delay: 10 Effect: Lightning Conductor (Increases your resistance to damage received through Lightning attacks) Requirements: Level 20+ **Misc.

Speak to her to start the quest. Hoshino Kei tells you, _\" Hurry, you must save us before we are fully claimed by the Undead! The Three are already gone, but they left behind noxious Bloodstones. Even now the stones are emanating the dark power that has awakened my people. They must be destroyed. My poor husband has already been turned to their sway and now guards the entrance to where the Bloodstones are kept. Purify a fragment of a Bloodstone and bring it back to me. Hurry, friend - there is not much time before I too shall fall sway to their power.\"_ Once you have the quest follow the southern wall until you see an opening, enter the opening and follow it to the portal to the Deeper Catacombs. Inside the Deeper Catacombs prepare for several large groups, follow the left wall this will lead you to the room Hoshino Kei's Husband resides Borelean Strathelar, do your best to lure the smaller melee class Skeletons out of the main room, the main room has Perchers that sit high and will fire down upon you. Once the melee class and the Perchers have been delt with pull Borelean Strathelar and kill him. On his body you will find a Worn Silver Key, loot it. | Worn Silver Key Behind Where Borelean Strathelar stood is a short passage that will lead you to a portal to the Neether Catacombs. Enter the portal and make your way through until you find a Sanguine Bloodstone, kill the bloodstone and loot a Bloodstone fragment, by doing so your quest will advance. At this point the quickest way to the next point is to portal recall and make your way back rather than fight your way back towards the portals. | Bloodstone fragment Once back inside the entrance, again follow the left wall until you reach the portal to Lower Catacombs.

Once inside the Forgotten Catacombs, make your way through until you find a locked door, use the Worn Silver Key on the door to access the room to the Sacred Font. Use the Bloodstone Fragment on the Sacred Font to recieve a Lifestone Fragment. Once again you have the choice to portal recall or fight your way back. Make your way back to Hoshino Kei, hand her the Lifestone Fragment. | Lifestone Fragment Hoshino Kei tells you,_ \"Only this could have saved me and mine from corruption. You are a truly worthy descendant of the heroes of our time.

{"page_content": "Crafting: Spellbinding ### Spellbinding This skill allows us to separate a spell from a loot item and put it into a item that can be used on other items of the same level or within five levels under the item you took the spell off of in the form of a Totem. Totems can be used on other items with one or more free Slots for spells including all crafted and looted weapons and armor. To do this we need Essences which come in the form of trophies. Which are random drop from many creatures around Dereth. A Essences Chart has been provided in the crafting section of this website Each Essences are only relevant to one particular class of Loot items. Recipes ask for a trophy that has a given Essence. The Minor Essence will rip off a random spell, but this won't be a problem on loot items with only one spell. The Major Essence will rip off all possible spells, but it costs more in resources The following chart will guide you into knowing what essences are needed for what type items. Class | Minor Essence | Major Essence Melee Weapons | Anger | Wrath Missile Weapons | Cunning | Guile Magic Weapons | Courage | Valor Human Armor | Reason | Inspiration Tumerok Armor | Empathy | Wisdom Lugian Armor | Tenacity | Fortitude Shields | Caution | Vigilance For more information about the various types of *Spell Effects* that can be obtained check our Spell Effects Guide written by: Billy Mountain. * Navigate AC2Hero * Home * Crafting * Quests * Guides * Items * Maps * Search * News * Related Links * turbine.com * asheronscall.com * ac2wiki.info * ac2crafters.com * * * * * * * * * * Feedback * Terms of Use * About Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings (C) 2004-2013 Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. /// Copyright (C) 2013 AC2Hero.com", "metadata": {"source": "http://ac2hero.e5i5o.com/spellbinding.html", "title": "AC2Hero", "description": "Asheron's Call 2 Hero is the most complete source for Asheron's Call 2(2013).

{"page_content": "S.H.R.E.T.H. Base Ultra (Group) ### Quest Name: S.H.R.E.T.H. Base Ultra (Group) **Requirements:** Level 46+ **Reward:** % based XP - 3% needed to level **Time Limit:** 7 Days **Reset Timer:** 7 Day Reset **Start Location** : Justicar Maronak (10.3S, 31.6W), Linvak Tukal **Walkthrough:** Justicar Maronak tells you, _\"We have been investigating a secretive criminal organization known only as SHRETH. We mounted a large raid on their so-called secret base, but unfortunately, the base seems to have been abandoned. Our investigation is now at a standstill, unless you can uncover further clues about their operation.\"_ After you talk to Justicar Maronak, travel to the Frozen Ravine (9.9S, 54.7W) in East Gevoth. Frozen Ravine Map Once in Frozen Ravine you will need to run through and grab the torn scrap. From frozen ravine drop run forward and take the second passage on your right to the entrance door. From there, follow the path to the first room, take the passage on the left which will lead you to another room continue straight across, and then finally your next left. This will take you to a hall with outlets on your left and right. The Torn Scrap is in the last alcove on the right this will advance your quest. | Torn Scrap After picking up the Torn Scrap head to the Gurokora Ringway and take the northwest shelf portal. Mount up and travel to the Mysterious Portal at (29.7S, 50.2W). This will take you to a good sized island filled with various Gromnies. From the drop run forward and follow the path up to the left which will take you through a cavern walk way and eventually to a door with many single letter buttons. Use the buttons to spell out \"SHRETH\" then use the door to enter. Once inside do not take any lefts or rights, just continue straight. There are mobs named \"flunky\" but they will not attack unless attacked first. The best thing to do is to not fight the monsters in here, but the instant you do attack anything, you get an \"Alarm\" debuff effect that lasts for 4 hours that causes you to be aggro'd by all the monsters within the dungeon. Be warned that Shreth will randomly spawn on your group while this debuff is in effect. You will eventually come to a door labeled \"Warning\". Beyond it there are level 80 mobs that WILL attack you. So either kill them or run by them (they usually run out of aggro before the next part). After continuing straight you will come across the SHRETH Warden and his SHRETH Mascots. They will not attack you unless you attack first. You need to kill the Warden and loot a key. You can attack the warden without the shreths gaining aggro as long as you do not use any area of effect spells. So either pull the warden or do not use AOE. After looting the key, use it on the door to teleport to the next phase. From here on it is a maze that consists of SHRETH patrol guards that will mark you as a target for turrets which deal 700-900 dmg. The SHRETH patrol guards will mark you once they see or or if you are to close. The turrets have horrible accuracy and can easily be dodged by strafing, some skill required. Once marked, the spell can be removed by death or by the Order kingdom spell \"Call\". So it is wise to bring someone with rez or 2000 order kingdom points. For the record you can run through to the boss by yourself, some skill required (in case a fellow mate dies and they know the way). Once inside the next area continue straight until you enter the giant cave. Stay back and observe from afar the guards standing in front of the ramp. There are 2 on the ground and 1 at the top of the ramp. The patrols do what their name says and patrol. So if they are not there, then they will be walking around. If they are there, sit tight and wait for them to move on with their patrol route. Another method is having a tank run up and have them chase him away from the ramp while the team runs by without getting marked. The tank will get marked so either \"call\" him or have him die and then rez him. Once they are distracted or on thier patrol quickly run up the ramp and take the second left. It is a safe spot to regroup once once out of range of the patrols. Continue straight and proceed up the big ramp. Towards the top, to your LEFT, there is another path. You will need to jump to this path. After you made the jump continue left (if you are facing the new path from the big ramp it is left). Follow the path up and around past a total of 3 turrets (if you are not marked they wont attack) and into the next door for phase 3. From drop continue straight, into the giant room, and find the next door in front of you that is guarded by 2 turrets. If you ID the door it says locked, but it is not really locked. Open the door and continue into the maze tower (note that the door can only be opened upon entering; meaning once inside you can not open the door. Though this does not affect anyone, unless your attempting to open the door for a marked group member trying to run past the turrets.) The tower maze consists of walls and hidden doors which will help you avoid other turrets on your way up. Once you make it to the top there is a wall that will open to a long bridge, which leads to the door to phase 4 If you are marked the next drop will be difficult for you as it has 2 turrets guarding the drop area, which will be located behind you. Run forward and dodge to get around the bend. From here just go straight until you observe a room with SHRETH members lv. 80's that will attack if you get to close. Keep in mind that there are patrols, do avoid them if possible. Head to the Commander's office where you will find Number Two (lvl 80), Group class creature. Once he is defeated loot him for a key to the loot door. | Key Behind the crowd of SHRETH members is a door. The key looted fromt he commander will unlock that door which will teleport you to the chest room. So if you run by the crowd keep in mind youll need enough time to use the key and then use the door. Once key is used door is operable for the entire fellow. Use the chests to gain your reward. Once this thas been done return the decoded document to Justicar Maronak (10.3S, 31.6W) in Linvak Tukal to get your reward. **Misc.

Nalica(order) or Naokim(shadow) will also allow you to start this quest **Walkthrough:** Before taking on this quest you will want to collect several items that will be needed to give to Aun Tanaua and to make a Disguise to allow you entrance into the fortress. Kill Fanatics which can be found across Linvak Massif, Arramora and various locations in Omishan. You may wish to gather a small group to do this as they are generally in small packs and are of level 65 and 70 with 7100-8900 hitpoints each. Each member of your group will need each item to create the disguise. Make sure everyone in fellowship has an Order Doctrine to hand in to complete their quest. For the other items only 1 person in the fellowship needs to hand in. | Bloody Doll | Found on the body of a Fanatic | Broken Shield | Found on the body of a Fanatic | Broken Sword | Found on the body of a Fanatic | Guard Diary | Found on the body of a Fanatic | Order Doctrine | Three Doctrines Quest | Stained Diary | Found on the body of a Fanatic | Torn Letter | Found on the body of a Fanatic | Volkama Fetish | Found on the body of a Fanatic Each member of your group will need the following to create a Disguise to enter the Fortress, the Disguise will also allow you safe passage by many of the creatures within the fortress. | Fanatic Armor Fragment | Fanatic Armor Scrap | Tattered Fanatic Armor Plate | Shredded Fanatic Armor Plate Once you have gathered these items double click each item (Fanatic Armor Fragment, Fanatic Armor Scrap, Tattered Fanatic Armor Plate) and use it on the Shredded Fanatic Armor Plate to create the Fanatic Disguise. | Incomplete Fanatic Disguise | After adding the first part to the Shredded Fanatic Armor Plate | Partial Fanatic Disguise | After adding the second part to the Shredded Fanatic Armor Plate | Fanatic Disguise | After adding the third part to the Shredded Fanatic Armor Plate Dominion go and speak to Imperator Thromer Olvidan within the Imperatorial Court, speak with the Virindi Adumbrator (10.4N, 63.2E) in Ikeras to gain access. To begin the quests. Imperator Thromer Olvidan tells you, _\"Aun Tanua has raided our people again! I don't know much of his history, but I'm told he's an old-time hero of the Order of Dereth. How could someone sworn to virtue turn into such a rabid killer? I have no idea what motivates him, and to be honest, I don't much care. His potential for harm must be suppressed! Therefore, in the name of the Quiddity and the People of the Dominion, I command you to find Aun Tanua and terminate his threat. It is so ordered in Council on this day of Harvestgain, Portal Year 500.\"_ _\"Our mages have unraveled Aun Tanua's outer defenses. Here is a glyph key that should open the front door. Beyond that point, you must rely on your own abilities. Good luck.\"_ | Fortress Glyph Key #### Kill Kogun Now that you have the disguise you can enter Aun Tanua's fortress portal at (8.3S, 43.2E) southwest of Mayoi. Once there you need to cross an invisible bridge. On the other side is an orb, give the Fortress Glyph Key to the orb and use it to go in. You can now use orb anytime, even if you die and need to come back. Aun Tanua's Fortress Map Once inside head down the passage, until you reach the Fanatics, travel left, do not venture to the right, or wisps will spawn on you. You will find yourself in room with 3 portals and an open hole in the floor, where you can see an acid pit with acid spurts. Use the South portal, to portal up one level, then use the portal that will be on your left, so it would end up being, form the bottom, S-E-N-W-S-E. You will the find yourself in what is like a maze. Turn out of the passage so you are facing South. The trick is to avoid all red passages, levers and gates, while moving left whenever you can. Head down the South passage, and take the 2nd left. Follow this passage and take the right at the end of the passage. From here, you should be facing South and a gate at the same time, turn left here, and take your first right, then turn left at the end. Head to the end of the passage, and turn right twice, then left twice, then follow the passage to the end, turning right, you will reach 3 gates, and a field of portals behind them. Of all the levers, there is only one that does not spawn Wisps onto your group. To get to this lever you need to take all rights as you enter, unless you can go left. Pass the gates into the field of portals, avoid the blue portals and search for a Teal colored one which is found in the bottom right hand corner of the room, on the nearest row, 2nd from the wall. Use this portal. The portal will take you into another passage, follow it straight down, and you will reach a room with a wall in front of you. Behind this wall are fanatic rangers, sages, juggernauts and zealots, as well as the boss, Kogun. Here your disguise will not work, and you must defeat Kogun. Kogun is a level 75 Juggernaut, with 90k health and vigor. Defeat him to complete the Kill Kogun quest. The next step is a one time quest that can not be repeated. #### Stop Aun Tanua Now with Kogun defeated head into the second room were Aun Tanua is waiting. Hand him the items in correct order below. Once all the items have been handed in by the Fellowship leader, the other members of the Fellowship should now turn in thier Order Doctrine to Aun Tanua. 1\\. Bloody Doll 2\\. Guard Diary 3\\. Stained Diary 4\\. Torn Letter 5\\. Volkama Fetish 6\\. Broken shield 7\\. Broken Sword 8\\. Order Doctrine Once the last item has been given a Cutscene will begin and the quest will complete. **Misc.

{"page_content": "Spirit Guide ### Quest Name: Spirit Guide **Requirements:** 36+ **Reward:** 400,000 XP Red Fire Cesta **Time Limit:** 1 Days **Reset Timer:** 3 Day Reset **Start Location** : Amano-Bal (28.1N, 55.2E), near the Deru Tree. **Walkthrough:** Amano-Bal tells you, _\" Greetings, child. The ancient Tonk spirits have awakened! Can you not hear their whispers? I have been summoned to this world from holy Ezheret itself. The time has come to purge the land of the evil influence of the Burun. The ritual is complex and lengthy, and it must be repeated periodically, but the longest journey begins with a single stride. Take this wand. Seek out a Tonk of pure spirit to bless it, and return to me.\"_ | Wand of Cleansing Travel to the town of Zu by way of Ikeras once in Zu give the wand to Akkilea Akkilea tells you, _\" What? Amano-Bal? Manifest here on Dereth! Amazing! You are fortunate to see such a thing in this sad and debased age. Indeed, we are all fortunate that the children of Ezheret have at least seen fit to work their will in the world. What? You ask me to bless the Wand of Cleansing? I, a pure spirit? I hardly think such a thing is possible. No, you must be mistaken....\"_ \"But who am I to say whether I am pure or debased. I am certainly not wise enough to say. Here, I will give you my blessing. May it serve you well... may it serve us all well!\" Now return it to Amano-Bal in Rakani. Amano-Bal tells you, _\" Well done, child. Now the ritual can begin. You must seek out each of the 11 Tonk shrines in turn. Offer each the wand. When you have received 11 blessings, return the wand to me.\"_ You must now visit the Tumerok Shrines In the order given and hand them the wand for their blessing: 1\\. Shrine to Palenqual (18.5N 53.4) Northeast Ariaki _You offer the wand to the shrine. For a moment nothing happens, but then a strange feeling of immanence surrounds you. You sense a weak and faded spirit that seems to be calling to you across a vast stygian abyss, but its voice is too faint to make out any words. The image of a lush and beautiful island, illuminated by a brilliant sunrise, briefly appears in your mind's eye. The image fades and you are overcome with a terrible feeling of sadness and loss. Nevertheless, a small spark of spiritual energy flares briefly around the wand._ 2\\. Shrine to Brother Volkama (37.8N 62.2E) Northeast Naderu Outpost Shrine to Brother Volkama tells you, _\" Cleansing? Purging? Purifying? Good, good. Little one, this ritual is long overdue. Let us wash the taint from our lands.\" _ _You see a vision of tiny rivulets flowing down mountains, merging together to form streams which in turn combine to form mighty rivers. Water flows from the highest peaks down to the sea. Brief impressions of leaping fish, curvetting reedsharks, and basking armoredilloes flash before your mind's eye. Finally you see a long-disused channel choked with rotting reeds. Foul mucor beasts drip slime on the polluted silt of the old riverbed, and fleshy poisonous toadstools grow everywhere. In the distance, you hear a powerful rumbling, and a huge wall of water rushes down the channel, obliterating the corrupted growths. In its wake, a vital, healthy river flows through a cleansed land._ 3\\. Shrine to Brother Tanea (3.2N 85.6E) Hakata _You offer the wand to the shrine. You smell the rich aroma of cedar and pine needles, feel the feathery brush of fern fronds between your fingers, and see the awesome height of a Deru tree rising before you, reaching hundreds of feet above the lesser trees around it. Flashes of experience thrill through you: for a moment, you are a squirrel scampering over a branch, a raptor stooping on the squirrel, a rabbit fleeing an unseen foe, and a shreth hungrily seeking its prey. The flashes of animal lives fade, and you feel an awesome silence descend on the primeval forest of your vision. Somewhere, in the heart of the forest, you sense a source of taint, of corruption, which feels like a gaping wound in your chest, as if your heart had been ripped out of your body, leaving a painful void. After what seems an eternity, a deep voice breaks the silence:_ Shrine to Brother Tanae tells you, _\" The forests and jungles of Omishan are blighted, tainted. This must be set aright. Receive now my blessing, seeker, and cleanse the land of its poisons.\"_ 4\\. Shrine to Mother Aundetanga (32.4N 66.1E) Northeast Naderu Outpost _You offer the wand to the shrine. You feel a clean cold wind and see a vision of snow glistening on a mountaintop. Black granite crags thrust through the snow, sheltering small outcroppings of grass. In a cleft between jagged peaks, a sun-drenched valley is filled with wildflowers. Somewhere in the distance you hear the high lonesome cry of an eagle... Then your vision plunges deep within the mountain's stone body. You sense the strength and solidity of living rock and feel a deep vital connection to the depths of Auberean. But something is not right at the heart of things... you feel a flaw, a rift, deep underground, slowly contaminating the very rock itself... As the vision fades, a crackling harsh voice resonates, so deep and slow it is felt almost as much as it is heard:_ Shrine to Mother Audetanga tells you, _\" Mend the flaw.... Repair the breach.... Seal the rift.... Cleanse the taint....\"_ 5\\. Shrine to Great Sister Rain (4.8S 93.6E) Sanctuary _You offer the wand to the shrine. For a moment all is quiet, then you hear thunder rolling in the distance, faint at first, then growing louder, closer... You sense a horrible emanation of corruption and decay from the earth beneath your feet, and anger and rage from above. The sky darkens as storm clouds gather overhead. Suddenly a deluge of rain slams down upon you, the violence of the storm almost overwhelming in its power and strength. Bolts of lightning lash the ground around you, momentarily throwing the landscape into stark relief, and deafening thunderclaps shake the earth. The sense of rage intensifies as you realize that the storm has failed to cleanse the poisoned land around you. After a time, the thunder and lightning cease, and the deluge diminishes into a warm, gentle misting rain. A soft female voice diffuses through the mist:_ Shrine to Great Sister Rain tells you,_ \"Yes, mortal, the land is tainted beyond my power alone to heal it. Take this blessed wand, and use it in my name. Oh.... Kiss my sister for me, when you meet her, if you would be so kind....\"_ 6\\. Shrine to Great Sister Wind (26.6N, 58.5E) Rakani _You offer the wand to the shrine. For a moment nothing happens, but then a breeze begins to waft around you. The wind intensifies, gusting, blowing, soon becoming a screaming cyclone. Small dust devils spin nearby, and in the distance you see a funnel cloud headed your way. The tornado grows larger, darker. Where it contacts the earth, debris flies upward, blasts of tainted earth spraying in all directions. But you can sense that the wind's action does not affect the source of the pollution deep beneath your feet. The lashing winds slowly die down, and the tornado dissipates into wispy clouds which rapidly disperse. A last dust devil dances before you, and you feel a soft breath of gentle air on your lips. You hear a breathy female voice whispering in your ears:_ Shrine to Great Sister Wind tells you, _\" Mortal, you must complete your circuit. All our powers together are necessary to cleanse the land. Oh, yes.... Tell my sister that one kiss is not enough....\"_ 7\\. Shrine to Black Mother Earth (13.5N 61.0E) Ikeras _You offer the wand to the shrine. You suddenly feel yourself to be embedded in the earth. You sense myriad roots reaching down through the soil, soaking up water and nutrition. Living spores nurture themselves in the black earth, and insect and animal life burgeons around you. Countless small creatures burrow through the earth, refreshing it as they travel, and the deaths of other plants and animals renew the earth with their essence.... But there is something wrong.... Poison seeps up into the rich dark loam from below, contaminating not only the soil, but all the living creatures which depend on the soil.... Life itself is corrupted by the taint. The natural process of corruption and decay is out of control in the earth, destroying more than it renews, rendering life down into vile pollution. You can do nothing, you are completely passive and powerless to act.... A great frustration fills your heart.... Thick, slow words form in your ears:_ Shrine to Black Mother Earth tells you, _\" My body is poisoned, cancerous. The taint must be purged. You must complete the circuit and finish the ritual. It is my only hope for salvation.\"_ 8\\. Shrine to Blue Mother Heaven (8.5N, 65.8E) Southern Tou Tou Outpost _You offer the wand to the shrine. Your vision ascends in a dizzying spiral up to the sky. You can see in all directions at once, viewing the entire expanse of Auberean from every angle. Islands, archipelagoes, continents dance beneath you. All over Auberean, monstrous Olthoi thrive, dominating almost all other life forms, save in a small group of islands you recognize as Dereth and the sad remnants of lost Palenqual. Even there, numerous Olthoi can be seen, yet these are different from the rest, somehow divorced from the million other interconnecting hives and warrens. Your attention focuses on Omishan. You can sense a deep source of contamination beneath the land, welling upward to poison everything it touches. Yet from your lofty vantage, far-seeing though it may be, you can do nothing; you cannot reach the ground, and your power cannot touch the source of corruption. A high clear voice echoes in your mind:_ Shrine to Blue Mother Heaven tells you, _\" Sight alone avails nothing in the face of evil. Action must follow vision. Take this wand, complete the ritual, and purify the land.\"_ 9\\. Shrine to Hazahtu, The Blind Eye (32.6N 50.5E) Northwest Naderu Outpost _You offer the wand to the shrine. Darkness descends on you, blotting out all vision. Absolute silence surrounds you, and you feel yourself floating in a vast, hot, dark, heavy medium. Somewhere, beyond the bounds of your normal senses, you know there is a place of light, of harmony, of life and vitality. You feel a great yearning for this place, but know that you cannot ever reach it.... Yet you are nevertheless content to rest here in the weight, in the silence, in the warmth, in the darkness. Merely knowing that the other place exists is enough for you. Now though, you can somehow perceive a flaw in the place of brightness, a defect which lets in a vile darkness far different from the eternal night which surrounds and nurtures you. The flaw must be repaired, the light perfected, but you cannot even see that other place, much less reach it... The memory of a voice emerges in your mind, you cannot remember how it sounds, but these are its words:_ Shrine to Hazahtu, the Blind Eye tells you, _\" For the light which I cannot see, I bless your quest, seeker. Go and heal the realm of life.\"_ 10\\. Shrine to Ezereth, Great father Sea (7.2s 72.4E) Shinoko _You offer the wand to the shrine. Your sense of place slowly dissolves as you feel yourself covering Auberean, surrounding the land, embracing all of creation. Though you can easily perceive them, you care little for the doings of the creatures which inhabit the pitiful outcroppings of soil and rock which emerge from the waves, for you are unchanging and eternal, and they are but poor small ephemeral things. Yet in the end they will return to your embrace, and they are all your children, whether you will it or not. Beneath one of those small patches of land, a source of corruption bubbles and breeds. Where it contacts the waters of the world-sea, the ocean is poisoned. You feel a slow, vast sense of outrage, yet you are powerless to prevent the spread of the contamination. Vast, crashing, roaring words resound in your head, drowning out all reason and sense, awesome in their intensity, intelligible only in retrospect:_ Shrine to Ezheret, Great Father Sea tells you, _\" Go, little one, take my power, combine it with the power of my children, destroy the evil, cleanse the land. GO NOW AND DO MY WILL!\"_ 11\\. Shrine to Wharu (10.2N 46.0E) Eastern Kydi, you must climb the walls of the mountain to reach this shrine. _You offer the wand to the shrine. You sense vindictive amusment and a vicious spitefulness. No words are spoken from the shrine, but you hear instead a jeering contemptuous laughter which has an oddly insect-like quality to it. The wand rolls off the shrine, rejected and unchanged._ The Shrine of Wharu has rejected the wand. Return to and hand Amano-Bal the wand. Amani-Bal tells you, _Ah....

You will need all four Library items to complete the quest. | Arcanum Book | Arcanum Codex | Arcanum Scroll | Arcanum Tome There are books located in the Arcanum Vault that give players a vague brief discription on how to attain the books: _\"_Of Arcanum Caches_ We of the Arcanum leave this Vault and this Book as gifts to whatever future generation may find them. Seeing the horror that was upon us, with the Hopeslayer once more set loose, we of the Arcanum have scattered our vast stores of knowledge and artifacts in secret caches throughout Dereth. It is our hope that this will preserve some fragment of our wisdom -- wisdom that you can use to restore this world.Contained in this, the only book we left behind in the Vault, are the secrets of these caches and the means of revealing them. _Of Caches_ Each cache contains arms, armor, and other artifacts from our treasuries. Each cache also contains a work from our libraries, as knowledge is more important than any artifact. These caches have been scattered near towns and other sites throughout Dereth. The location of each cache has been recorded in a reckoning gem, hundreds of which lie within this Vault.To uncover a cache, you will need to use the correct gem in close proximity to its hidden location. The gem will reveal the dig point for the cache and dissolve, having served its purpose. If you are not at the proper location, the gem will indicate the direction you need to travel. Although the reckoning gem will lead you to a dig point, you cannot simply dig up the cache. Wards have been set around each cache to prevent its contents from falling into the wrong hands. In addition, our Lugian members have constructed hundreds of Minions, creatures of rock and stone based on the ancient Empyrean golems, to protect each cache. To defeat these defenders, you will need to use a Recondite Machine to disable the alarm wards. _Of Recondite Machines_ A Recondite Machine is a complex mechanism that disables the wards disguising a cache and neutralizes the hidden Minions protecting it. It is imperative that the machine be of the highest quality, or it may fail to reveal the cache.Worse, a faulty machine may activate all of a cache's Minion protectors.

The Clothbound Book contains the following text: _ The Breaking of the Blade by Bayuji Lai, monk of Hebian-To I was in my second year of apprenticeship to Master Shiju of Shoushi when I became entangled in the legend of Ben Ten I remember it so well. It was a quiet summer afternoon and I was practicing my sword forms in the meditation courtyard of Shoushi, repeating the overhead sweep for the thousandth time. My follow-through and the angle of my leading arm are inadequate. Master Shiju had just given me a smart crack in the elbow with his staff, when a warrior appeared at the north gate, carrying a plain, but clearly well-forged tachi. It was a hot day, and I was pouring sweat from my exertions in the humid, swampy air of Shoushi. The stranger, however, seemed to show no discomfort at the heat, despite his black leather armor and black hood. I watched as they greeted each other with furtive hand signs. The warrior bowed to me, and I could see his eyes sizing me up for a long time, judging me. He must have decided I was worthy of acknowledgement, or at least posed no threat, because he finally bowed to me, very quickly. I bowed back, politely, as Master Shiju had taught me. We walked for a long time. Long enough for me to feel the fatigue of the journey, after almost a full day of weapon practice. I was grateful to walk three paces behind Master Shiju, because he surely would have been quite displeased with my lack of stamina. We walked into the mountains to the southwest of Shoushi, into the lands claimed by the friendly Lugian mountain lords. We passed a few of great grey warriors on our way into the highlands, each of whom nodded respectfully to my Master and to the stranger. Finally, we came upon a very small gap between two peaks, well concealed by thick tree cover. Through the gap was a trail into a narrow valley, heavily forested with evergreens. At the far end of the valley, under the shadow of a mountain peak, sat a small hut in the deep forest. As I said, the entrance to the valley was well hidden, and I doubt that I could retrace my steps there. No doubt if I possessed more of the mental discipline Master Shiju preaches, I would have remembered better. We stopped at the door and set our packs and weapons down outside. Master Shiju gave me a familiar hand signal: it was the signal that, for the ensuing meeting, I should be seen and not heard, not to speak unless spoken to. I nodded obediently. Satisfied, Master Shiju nodded to me and opened the door, beckoning me inside. The stranger remained outside, either to guard the door or to give us privacy with whatever mysterious person dwelled within. When I stepped through the door, I saw that the hut's inside was just as humble as the outside. The only furnishings were a bedroll, a low table, a bookcase, and a stone cooking pit. A precious, perfect bonsai tree sat on the table. There was no fire in the cooking pit, but I saw a tea kettle and a pair of bowls sitting nearby. In the dim light, it took me a moment to see that there was someone sitting on the bedroll. Once my eyes adjusted, I saw that the occupant of the hut was very old. Very old, and... probably a woman. She sat huddled in blankets, with a bowl of tea clutched in her hands. From what little I could tell of her under the blankets, she probably had once been very tall. When she extended her arms in greeting and offered us bowls of tea, I could see that she still had the limbs and movements of a warrior... of a fellow devotee of the way of the tachi. As I accepted the bowl of tea from her with a silent nod of thanks, I dared to look into her eyes. In those eyes, I saw an unfathomable sadness and endless compassion - as if she bore the sufferings of the world on her aged shoulders. Master Shiju and I drank our tea quietly. While Master and the old woman seemed to be having an entire conversation with subtle gestures and glances, I tried to puzzle out who this mysterious hermit might be. I had never heard mention of anyone like her in any of the Master's many war stories. I knew the Master's mother was long dead, slain in the early days before our people came under the protection of the lifestones when the Master himself had been a mere boy. I read the titles of the books in the bookshelf - ancient copies of the writings of Jojii and many of the legends of the Sho. Legends that are now long forgotten, lost in the endless wars our people have confronted on this troubled island... Lost as more of our people put aside the heritage we carried from Ispar to put together a united front with the Aluvians and the Gharu'n, and the Aun and the Lugians. Artifacts belonging to the Isparians we once were, not the Derethians we have become. Finally, Master Shiju set down his bowl and nodded. The old woman nodded back, and reached behind her, into a pile of furs and cloth at the side of the bedroll. To my surprise, she drew out a long, thin, cloth-wrapped bundle. The cloth was the finest thing I had seen in the hut - it was dark, midnight blue, and had the sheen of old and fine silk. It was the sort of fabric I could imagine hanging in the magnificent temples of Chiran-Tou. Of course, what was wrapped in the silk turned out to be even more wondrous. It was a tachi of unsurpassed beauty. The blade shone silver-blue, even in the poor light of the hut. The hand-guard was carved from platinum. A deep green jade jewel sat in the pommel, almost pulsing with light. A bright key hung from a tassel at the end of the pommel, as if the sword were a key to unlocking a great treasure, as well as a wondrous weapon. Looking upon that tachi, I was suddenly struck with the knowledge of who this lonely old woman must be. Completely forgetting my Master's instructions, I whispered, 'Ben Ten.' The woman's eyes widened in surprise and, perhaps, amusement. Then I felt a stinging crack as Master Shiju thumped me between the shoulder blades with his cane. 'Have you forgotten yourself, Bayuji?' Master Shiju hissed. 'You were told not to speak until spoken to!' The old woman, Ben Ten, reached out and put a firm grip on Master Shiju's wrist. He dropped the cane and sat next to me, suddenly humbled. I found myself feeling uncomfortable and awkward, as if I were being exposed to things I should not know. Finally, I heard the old woman speak. 'Master Shiju, please humor me and punish your student no more. He has brought joy to an old woman's heart. I forget the principle of Humility, because I enjoy knowing that this young one knows of me. 'She turned to me and, to my shock, spoke to me directly. 'It has been many years since our people came to this land. We have been through so much. We escaped the captivity of the Olthoi. We managed to fend for ourselves and settle a hostile land. We survived the days of the Hopeslayer's wrath, when the rivers ran red and the sky was black. We withstood the invasions of the walking wind and corrupted toad demons. We defeated the hateful designs of sorcerers and tyrants. 'She paused to take a sip of her tea, and set the tachi on the floor between us. 'The spirits tell me that greater perils lie ahead. Our people change. The more time they spend here, the less they remember of the ancient ways of Ispar, of the Four Stones and the Three Elders. The way of Jojii is scarcely remembered. The humble swordswoman who helped defend our first settlements has been forgotten. Except by a few well-trained apprentices,' she laughed. 'The spirits are withdrawing from this world,' she sighed. 'In time, I must leave with them, as well. So I have called my old friend, Master Shiju, who was once a tender and frightened child who needed protection from the Reedsharks near his home village, to see me one last time. 'At this, Master Shiju bowed deeply enough to touch his forehead to the dirt floor. I quickly dropped my own forehead to the floor and closed my eyes. 'I asked that Master Shiju come here, and bring his student, because I have tasks for you both. Please, raise yourselves up. I am not here for reverence, and, to be honest, it embarrasses me. 'We both looked up at her as she took the sword in both hands. She raised it in the air, so high over her head that its tip nearly touched the thatch roof of the hut, and brought it sweeping down on the stones of her hearth. There was a sound like the breaking of a thousand harp strings, and the sword shattered. 'No!' I cried, unable to restrain myself. I reached for the broken pieces of the wondrous, legendary Sword of Ben Ten. 'Sit back!' Ben Ten barked at me, and before I knew it, I was bowing on the floor again. 'It would seem, Master Shiju, that your student has forgotten the stones of Detachment and Discipline. 'Not daring to raise my eyes, I heard a long-suffering sigh come from my master beside me. 'Raise your eyes,' Ben Ten said. No longer did she seem the frail old woman. Now she was strong, full of purpose, and radiant in her authority. 'Before her, she had arrayed the pieces of the broken sword. The blade was mostly intact. Next to it sat the platinum hand-guard, the piece of jade, the key on the tassel, and the sharp, narrow tang of the blade. 'The sword serves no more purpose to the people of Dereth. It will diminish and disappear, just as its guardian spirits have done,' Ben Ten intoned. 'And yet, in the wisdom of the Elders, the broken pieces of the sword will benefit those who are in need. Master Shiju, I would like for you to dispose of four of these pieces for me. 'Master Shiju nodded reverently. 'I owe you my life and more, Ben Ten. Just tell me what you would like me to do. 'She pointed at the key. 'The key will go to Baishi. A young woman who seeks spiritual fulfillment will find that the key opens up a long-forgotten chest of books in the back of her mother's shop, books full of the teachings of Jojii. 'She pointed at the tang of the blade. 'The tang will go to Tou Tou, where an aging archer who must defeat one last foe will find it makes a perfect arrowhead for his final shot. 'She pointed at the platinum hand-guard. 'The hand-guard will go to Lin, where a starving clothmaker with a broken loom will find that this carved metal fits just so into his device. 'She pointed at the piece of jade. 'The jade will go to Yanshi, where an orphaned brother and sister will be able to sell it, and provide for themselves in the absence of their parents. 'She pointed at the blade. 'The blade, Bayuji, will go with you. Take it with you, wherever you go, and think about all you have seen and heard today. Ask yourself what becomes of a blade with no handle. Think of all the things that the blade has slain, think of all the blood that the blade has shed. And remember the lessons of this blade in the coming darkness, when the spirits have abandoned us and Jojii is remembered no more. 'Reverently, I took the blade in my hands and bowed deeply again. 'The spirits are retreating. A reckoning is coming, between those who once owned this world and those who would own it now. The shadow will return and bring war, and other powers will rise to oppose it. They will sunder the land with their battle. But one day, when we all are dust and ash and our descendants will have to rebuild the world we made, the spirits will return. And the pieces of this sword will be brought forth at their command. Leave me now, please. I must meditate and finish my tea. 'Bowing and retreating, Master Shiju and I left the hut. I never saw Ben Ten again. But I do remember, with shame, the lessons that she taught me that day. Mindful of her last words to me, I have never raised my sword in anger, but only use it as a tool for teaching lessons of discipline and courage. And every night, I dream of the spirits fleeing our realm, in the face of the terrible destruction Ben Ten foretold. _ Gather or have gathered the following items from the following quests: | Rusty Blade | The Ruins of Hebian-To \\- Quest | Restless Spirit (13.8N_69.1E) | Muddy Wheel | The Ruins of Lin \\- Quest | Restless Spirit (11.9N_68.2E) | Lost Key | The Ruins of Baishi \\- Quest | Restless Spirit (13.6N_66.6E) | Aged Jade | The Ruins of Yanshi \\- Quest | Shi Ehrietawa (16.5N 73.9E) | Broken Arrow | The Ruins of Tou-Tou - Quest | Once all five items have been collected, you will be able to craft the final product Open your Skills Menu, Select your Crafting Tab, Scroll to the Bottom and select Quest Recipes, Here you will find a Recipe for Tachi of Ben Ten. | Tachi of Ben Ten Damage:147-196 Combat Delay: 15 Vigor Cost: 15 Minimum Level: 35 Must have completed the The Ruins of Tou-Tou Quest **Misc.

{"page_content": "Cleanse the Chaos Forge ### Quest Name: Cleanse the Chaos Forge **Requirements:** Level 50+ **Reward:** % based XP - 10% needed to level Augmented Kingdom Armor Kingdom Armor Upgraded Hero Star (with use of Chaos Crystal) **Time Limit:** 1 Days **Reset Timer:** 7 Day Reset **Start Location** : Quest will begin once you speak to the Hammer of Light within the Chaos Forge Dungeon. **Walkthrough:** This quest was designed for two purposes. First is to alow those without Kingdom affiliation to be able to gain a Star of Heros for the Arramora recall, for that purpose a person will need to complete the Destroy The Chaos Eidolon quest prior to running this dungeon. Second this quest allows those with a Kingdom affiliation the ability to upgrade or create their armor to Kingdom Armor. Enter the Chaos Plane located at (53.8N 10.2W) in the northern Osteth Battlefield region. You can get to this location from the Northern Arwic Outpost. Once inside you are now able to Portal Recall directly into the dungeon and directly to any other main portal there after. Travel down the stairs you will find a intersection that has directions notice your radar direction and take the Southeast passage. once you reach the top of this passage you will find a green portal take it to enter the CE/CF areas of the Chaos Plane. Once you have entered this new area look to your right you will see a small maze of beams that lead to a platform. On the platform you will see a NPC named Tormented Shadow Wraith and behind him will be a portal. Enter the portal to enter the Chaos Forge Dungeon. Chaos Forge Dungeon Map Once inside the Chaos Forge Dungeon travel west until you reach the corner killing soloable wisps as you travel, once at the corner travel north until you reach the next corner then travel east, north, east, south then east again. If this seems confusing view the map in the link above. Once you arive near the Forge there will be 3 Group level creatures kill them then make your way north to the unlocked door. Behind the door is the Hammer of Light and the Chaos Forge. _DO NOT CLICK ON THE FORGE_ it will put a debuff on you that will cause 300 damage over time for 5 minutes. Optional: This next step you will want to (try) and organize your fellowship to have them all click on the hammer once, then once all have have them all speak to him once more together as a group. repeating this process around 11 times. The reason for this is, If a player dies while on a platform and has to run back they can run past the Group level creatures and click the Hammer of Light once and join the group instead of twelve times and risk dieing again from the damage the group creatures cause. Speak to the Hammer of Light to start the Main quest and Sub quest, Once the last line of text has been posted you and your whole fellowship will be teleported to the First platform \"Red\". Hammer of light tells you, _Greetings, hero. I am the spirit of the Hammer of Light. Listen well to my words, if you would hear a tale of the ancient dawn of Dereth, a tale which began in the elder days that came before mortals were summoned to Auberean, and has not come to an end even in this debased epoch. In ancient times, the lords of Light created me as living artifact. They intended to forge items of virtue and power for the greatest of their children. The most powerful of the Empyrean smiths wielded me, and I learned wisdom in their hands. But after many ages passed, the children abandoned their heritage, and the divergent Empyrean tribes lost the way to my Forge. For eons I languished. The lords of Light turned their countenance away from their foolish children, and the children forgot the wisdom of their forebears. Down through the generations the great Forge of Light was abandoned, unused, hidden, and silent. But then something changed, and I woke from the sleep of ages. The entities you call the Virin'di discovered my hiding place. They overcame the ancient wards, and carried me off to a hidden retreat in portalspace where they slowly began to build the great machine they would call the Forge of the Dominion. They erected powerful defenses against the children of Light while they attempted to discover my secrets. In time, over many hundreds of years, they slowly learned to create items of power of their own for their mortal followers. Yet they reckoned not with the forces of Shadow. The sensitive perception of the one you call Bael'Zharon eventually detected my influence in portalspace. The Virin'di of that age had no defenses against the awesome Shadow magic of the Hopeslayer which he thrust beyond the angles of the world into the heart of portalspace. The Virin'di researchers working on the Forge of the Dominion were quickly overcome by the Shadow onslaught. Their connection to their great Singularity was severed, and without that font of power, they were no match for their attackers. Yet just when victory seemed to be in the hands of the attackers, a last Virin'di Inquisitor, already half-insane due to its disjunction from the Quiddity, managed to wield me as a weapon against the Shadow foe. Never in an age of ages had I been used as a weapon. The awesome power of the lords of Light, wielded without understanding by a demented servant of the Singularity, smashed the Shadows, broke enchantments, shattered minds, and brought down the very walls of reality. This region of portalspace was severed from the primary continuum. Like water breaking through a ruptured dam, raw Chaos flooded through the Forge portals from sources beyond the walls of the world. Most of the Shadows and Virin'di present were destroyed, either by the primary onslaught of the Hammer or the secondary effects of the raging tide of Chaos. A few shattered and twisted beings still haunt this region, along with the primal manifestations of Chaos which came from Outside. Over a few fleeting hundreds of years, the Forge of the Dominion has become a Chaos Forge. Since the efflux of Chaos, this region of portalspace has been isolated... until now. Something has happened to reconnect this region to a more traveled part of the continuum. I have no knowledge of what has transpired outside. My knowledge of the current state of affairs is very limited. I only know one thing.... I am no longer the Hammer of Light... ... I am now the Hammer of Chaos! Forgive me, mortal, but I cannot control my actions. A force I cannot name requires that I send you to a place prepared for your destruction. Please... if you survive... forgive me... Free me from my bondage, purify the Chaos Forge, and I will serve you if I can. Prepare yourself!_ ### Red Platform The first platform you reach will be Red, your whole fellowship will be split up between four locations each group will need to make there way to the center, killing any opposition along the way. Fellowship members who can Mesmerize (Mez) or stun for a period of time, should do so from this point until the end of the quest whenever possible. While making your way to the center of the platform DO NOT go straight from the drop off point, travel the far path as there is a False Floor your members can fall through. Once all have come within range of the center kill the Chaos Golems, Furious Chaos Wisps and keep the Boss Mesmerized if possible. Kill the Uplifted Chaos Golem, once the boss is dead your fellowship will be teleported to the next Platform. ### Yellow Platform The second platform Yellow, is the easiest of the five platforms. travel along the outter edge to the far end killing any opposition along the way of Chaos Golems and Furious Chaos Wisps. Kill the Ascended Chaos Golem to advance to the next platform. ### Green Platform The third platform Green, is inhabited by primarily Furious Chaos Wisps, make your way to the far end killing all wisps along the way. Kill the Resplendent Chaos Golem to advance to the next platform. ### Blue Platform The fourth platform Blue, the best course of action here is to jump across from path to path making your way towards the center, killing all Chaos Golems and Furious Chaos Wisps as you make your way across. Traveling the long way around will be a difficult task as the respawn timers are short. You will end up having to re-kill alot of spawns you killed before by the time you reach the boss. Clear the way to the boss mesmerize as much as your group can. Once your group is focused on the boss have them all on the center platform, there is a chance that you will not get the kill if the majority of your group is to far away. Kill the Exalted Chaos Golem to advance to the final platform. ### Purple Platform The fifth and final platform is Purple(Violet), just as the platform before it kill the Chaos Golems and Furious Chaos Wisps, jumping across towards the center. Kill the Supreme Chaos Golem. Once you kill the boss a Chaos Rift will appear, Double-Click the Rift to advance the quest, if for some reason a fellowship member did not get the advance the Rift will respawn and they will be able to use it. Once all have the advance jump across to the far end and either kill or run past the Chaos Storm or kill it to gain access to the portal back to the Chaos Forge. Once you are back to the Chaos Forge Speak to the Hammer of Light until the quest completes. If you are here to gain access to the Arramora Recall or for Kingdom Armor continue reading below. Hammer of Light tells you, _Thank you, hero, for purging the taint of chaos from this place. I fear that the dire influence may yet return, but for the moment, I am at your service. I am forbidden to communicate some of the more advanced techniques employed by my various ancient masters, but there are several elementary operations which may yet be of interest First of all, if you have armor forged according to the strictures of the Radiant Temple, I can upgrade those pieces. Simply place the pieces in the forge and they will be enchanted anew. Secondly, you may forge an entire new suit of Augmented Kingdom armor here. Begin by placing a huge pyreum gem into the forge, and I will then communicate the subsequent steps required to forge the new suit of armor. Finally, even if you are not affiliated with a Kingdom, you can use the forge to create the relic known as the Star of Heroes. Place a crystalline artifact of chaos in the forge, and I will transform it._ ### Arramora Recall To gain a Star of Heroes you must hand the forge one of two items. | Attuned Chaos Crystal | Attained from completing the Destroy the Chaos Eidolon quest | Chaos Power Crystal | Attained from the Nature's Ally quest A Star of Heroes when given to the Star Beacon in Southern Arramora will unlock the Arramora Recall ability. | Arramora Recall ### Upgraded Kingdom Armor/ Augmented Kingdom Armor Hand the forge existing Kingdom Armor (Of your current kingdom or not) to get a free upgrade of your Kingdom Armor to Augmented Kingdom Armor(Current Kingdom).

Find a card that suits you then return to The Fortune Teller(16.1N, 28.1E) in Cavendo and hand her the card you have selected to set your character's Significator card and enable Card Melding, you are also given a Book of Destiny which gives you a overview for melding. The Fortune Teller tells you, _\"So, you have chosen a <cardtype>. There... I have attuned it for your use. Experiment with its power, and seek your fate in the revealed patterns of destiny. You will find that certain card combinations which work well for you may not be so effective for others. Only through trial and error can the Seeker follow the Way of Fortune. Here, take these notes I have prepared, they will guide your initial attempts to make use of the power of the cards. Know, however, that I am but a humble apprentice, and the cards hold more secrets than ever I have discovered.\"_ The Fortune Teller tells you, _\" <cardtype> signifies the <carddiscription>\"_ | Book of Destiny The Book of Destiny says: _The Fortune Teller's Notes The cards conceal many secrets. I cannot claim to have learned more than a fraction of them myself; this pamphlet contains a few of my discoveries. The Dereth Tarot consists of two kinds of cards: Lesser Trumps and Greater Trumps. The Lesser Trumps are similar to the familiar playing cards used in various games, consisting of 14 ranks in 4 suits, namely the Ace through King of Swords, Skulls, Scepters and Drums. The Greater Trumps are not in any suit, and each has its own title and description.It is said that in the past there were many more trumps extant, but only twelve are currently known. Greater Trumps may be combined together magically to form melds. Only a few combinations of Greater Trumps in the many millions of possibilities can be combined in this manner, and short of trying them all, there is no way of knowing how many valid combinations exist. Many Seekers keep their discoveries secret, but I will break the seal of silence to give a simple example: the trumps called 'The Living Moon' and the 'Shattered Moon' may be combined to form a simple meld known as 'Twin Moons.' It is said that the more trumps which are combined to form a meld, the greater the power. Once a meld is formed, it may not be broken apart. The Greater Trumps involved in the meld are lost forever for other purposes. In fact, melds are so magically charged that they may not even be traded from one Seeker to another; a meld is an expression of personal spiritual power that will forever be attuned to the maker.Melds may be used to transform ordinary Lesser Trumps into powerful tokens called Fate Cards. Some Fate Cards can convey their power to items such as arms and armor, and other Fate Cards provide a magical benefit to any who cares to meditate on their mysteries. I should warn you, however, that a path once walked cannot be trod again. Each meld will only advance your spiritual quest for knowledge once, so it would be wasteful of the precious trumps to form multiple melds of the same type.The interaction between melds and Lesser Trumps is a mystery in and of itself. The Fate Card which results from the application of a meld to a Lesser Trump is to some extent determined by the meld, to some extent determined by the Lesser Trump, and to some extent, apparently, by the individual psyche of the Seeker performing the magical operation. While I cannot claim to have a complete understanding of this mystery, I will say this: Many Fate Cards are determined in some manner by the suit of the Lesser Trump in combination with the meld. Fate Card power seems to vary widely from one operation to another. It is my belief that the rank of the Lesser Trump plays an important part in determining the power of the resultant Fate Card._ Look forward to a Guide for known Tarot Melds soon here at ac2hero.com **Misc.

{"page_content": "### Quest Name: Legion of Doom (Group) **Requirements:** Level 55+ **Reward:** % based XP - 4% needed to level 2x Lodestones **Time Limit:** 24 Hours **Reset Timer:** 6 Day Reset **Start Location** : Malatawa (51.9S, 39.2E), Inside Fort Strathelar **Walkthrough:** Make sure your members stay together, even when more than one group is involved to reduce the chance that people will not get an advance or not be able to get items needed. Malatawa tells you, _\"You're an adventurer, aren't you? We don't have nearly enough troops in this area yet, and I'm all out of scouts. Maybe you can help me out with a little reconnaissance work.\"_ Talk again to advance. _\"Thank you for your time. I've been going over our scouting reports for this region, and they mention a new Olthoi mound around 51S, 31E. Olthoi activity in this area was supposed to be pretty minor, due to the Shield Wall, so this might be important. I want you to go in there and check it out. Let me know if you find anything interesting.\"_ Have everyone set their Lifestone at Fort Strathelar you will recall to here several times. Make your way to the Olthoi Mound cave at (50.3S, 31.1E). Have all Fellowship members enter at the same time especially Tank class, Olthoi may attack you once you have entered. Once the area is cleared, double- clicking the Support Pillar will advance the quest. Recall your Lifestone and speak to Malatawa (51.9S, 39.2E), Inside Fort Strathelar. Malatawa tells you,_\"Please go talk to the Gear Master.\"_ Now speak to the Gear Master (Downstairs). He says you need to search for a gear that works near the Shield Wall to open a door to the Gearknight dungeon. Gear Master tells you, _\"What? Knorr in ruins? Monsters everywhere? No wonder I haven't received any orders or maintenance request for 300 years!\"_ _\"The Olthoi are tunneling their way under the Shield Wall? This is terrible. If they manage to get past it, Knorr might be completely overrun! You must stop them. It may be that one of the reserve gear companies is still waiting in their vault. If you can activate them, you may be able to stop the Olthoi sappers by ordering the legionaries to countermine the Olthoi tunnels. Go to our forward fortifications, look for outpost sites which have a large gear on a pedestal. The pedestal can be used to summon a portal to the underground storage facility. If you find a functioning company, return to me with the news.\"_ Travel to the Gearknight Dungeon at (52.5S, 32.1E), double clicking the pedestal will portal you inside. DO NOT attack the Gearknights, ignore them and continue forward to a \" T \" intersection. Take the stairs on the left down and speak to Gear Captain Ratchet. Gear Captain Ratchet tells you, _\"Sir! 3rd Gearknight Assault Legion, Strike Company Artefon, Captain Ratchet commanding. Status: in reserve. Awaiting activation orders.\"_ Use your Lifestone recall, and speak with the Gear Master (Downstairs) at Fort Strathelar. Gear Master tells you, _\"Ah yes, the 3rd Assault Legion. Formally known as the Legion Consecrated to the Inevitable Doom of the Olthoi and the Propagation of Civilization Throughout Auberean, but we just call it the Legion of Doom for short. Anyway, listen up. Normally, of course, a Gearknight unit is perfectly capable of functioning without the constant need for human orders, but the company you've found are in reserve and its officers have turned off their volition controllers. In order to give orders to those troops, you'll need the Command Baton for their legion. Hopefully the batons are still in the armory someplace. There may be a number of batons there -- you want the one marked 3AL. I'll open the armory door for you.\"_ Your task now will be to retrieve a Baton 3AL (Only one is needed for fellowship quest advancement). Enter the Armory by way of the door on the left of the Gear Master. Head to the front hall, then to the room in the northeast. Kill the 3 Gearknights and loot a Key. Head to the Locked Door to the north and use the Key on the door to enter. Once inside go left and pick up the Baton 3AL. | Baton 3AL Lifestone Recall or walk back to the Gear Master (Downstairs) in Fort Strathelar. Gather your group together near the Gear master before handing in the Baton 3AL or they will NOT get the advance and you will have to redo this part of the quest again. Gear Master tells you, _\"Good job. Next you'll have to program the baton. I've configured the gears to 'set strike target'. Return to the location you wish the strike company to destroy, use the baton on a suitable landmark, and then give the baton to the company centurion. Unfortunately, reserve troops commanded in this manner often find it difficult to perform multiple tasks at the same time, so they will not be able to defend themselves very well from any olthoi who may respond to the attack. I suggest you and your fellows follow the Gearknights to their target and take care of any olthoi there while they do their work.\"_ Now go back to the Olthoi Mound (50.3S, 31.1E), once everyone is inside use the Baton on the Support Pillar like a key. Travel back to the Gearknight Dungeon (52.5S, 32.1E), once everyone is inside speak with Gear Captain Ratchet. Gear Captain Ratchet tells you, _\"Command baton accepted. Processing order sprockets. Orders found. Proceed to strike point. Countermine Olthoi tunnels. Sir! For honor and Artefon!\"_ _\"3rd Assault Legion Strike Company Artefon! By the numbers! Portal activation on my mark.... Activate portals!\"_ Ratchet will summon a portal to the Olthoi Mound, if you are accompanied by more than one fellowship Ratchet will not respawn in the original location again for approximately 5 minutes, the first group should use the portal then exit the mound until the second group arrives within the mound. Your task now is to use the Baton on the Support Pillar, this will begin the assault of the Gear Knights on the Support Pillar, Defend them until the task is complete. Once the Support Pillar dies a cutscene will begin. DISBAND the group before returning to Malatawa (51.9S, 39.2E), Inside Fort Strathelar to complete the quest or you will not recieve the Lodestones as part of the reward. Malatawa tells you, _\"Amazing! What an incredible tale of bravery and valor! Well, you have done us all a great service. I may not have many troops here, but I do have a few discretionary resources to allocate. Please accept this as a reward for your service.\"_ **Misc.

{"page_content": "Tarot Cards and Melds ### Tarot Cards and Melds #### Lesser Trumps: First we will go over the basics. Their are four decks Drums, Scepters, Skulls, and Swords. These four decks are concidered Lesser Trumps. They come in a collection much like standard playing cards Ace through King. At lower levels these cards are very valuable because of the buff they give, but they have no real purpose other than this until after you gain the ability to perform Melds at level 45 which we will go over further down the page. Ace | Deuce | Trey | Four | Five | Six | Seven | Eight | Nine | Ten | Princess | Knight | Queen | King | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Lesser Trumps no matter which you use in the set give the same buff and the same duration Below is a break down of those buffs. Icon | Type | Effect | Duration | Drums | Additional Maximum Vigor | 10 Minutes | Scepters | Additional Maxium Health | 10 Minutes | Skulls | Additional Combat Damage | 10 Minutes | Swords | Additional Combat Speed | 10 Minutes #### Greater Trumps: Once you reach 45+ You may begin finding the cards known as Greater Trumps. These normally drop from creatures of higher level but are not a common drop such as weapons and armor. Also at level 45 you will be able to do the quest that unlocks Melding called Tarot: Significator. Melding is the ability to merge Greater Trump cards into something more powerful. For example The Living Moon + The Shattered Moon = Twin Moons, when you double click on the item that is created(Twin Moons) you will gain 1% XP. This is a one time use then the created item disappears from inventory. Lets go over the 15 different Greater Trumps and there associated Melds. Icon | Name | Tarot | Associated Melds | The Bane | Knorr Tarot | Gateway: The Great Error | The Crafter | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Apprentice, Gateway: Grandmaster, Gateway: Journeyman, Gateway: Master, Three Paths | The Devourers | Knorr Tarot | Gateway: The Great Error | The Empyrean | Knorr Tarot | Gateway: The Great Error | The Eternal | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Order and Chaos, Gateway: Seeker in Darkness, Three Powers | The Great Tree | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Seeker in Light, Three Powers | The Imperator | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Order and Chaos, Gateway: Seeker in Light, Three Kingdons | The Indwelling | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Order and Chaos, Gateway: Seeker in Darkness, Three Powers | The Living Moon | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Order and Chaos, Gateway: Seeker in Light, Twin Moons | The Lord of Light | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Seeker in Light, Three Kingdoms | The Seeker | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Seeker in Darkness, Gateway: Seeker in Light, Three Paths | The Shadow | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Seeker in Darkness, Three Kingdoms | The Shattered Moon | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Gateway: Order and Chaos, Gateway: Seeker in Darkness, Twin Moons | The Warrior | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power, Three Paths | Those Who Are Called | Dereth Tarot | Deck of Power #### Melds: At this point you are wondering \"Melds?\". Melding is basicly taking two, three, five or twelve different cards and making a single card out of them. When you use the Significator Card you recieved from the Tarot: Significator quest on the melds you can gain a experience bonus of either crafting experience or level experience. If you use the Melds onto a Lesser Trump you will produce a Fate Card, we will go over that in the section below this one. One thing to note is that there is no specific order in which you need to place these cards into the slots. I will now go over the four types of Meld products then list the known meld solutions. Icon | When Significator used on Meld type | When Meld used on a Lesser Trump | One time use for XP or CXP | Combined to make Fate Cards | One time use for XP or CXP | Combined to make Fate Cards | One time use for XP or CXP | Combined to make Fate Cards | One time use for XP or CXP | No Product Two Card Melds Icon | Solution | Cards Needed | Significator Used | Gateway: Apprentice | The Crafter + The Crafter | 2500 CXP | Gateway: The Plague | The Bane + The Devourers | 1% XP | Gateway: The Summons | The Empyrean + Those Who Are Called | 1% XP | Twin Moons | The Living Moon + The Shattered Moon | 1% XP Three Card Melds Icon | Solution | Cards Needed | Significator Used | Gateway: Journeyman | The Crafter + The Crafter + The Crafter | 3000 CXP | Gateway: The Great Error | The Bane + The Devourers + The Empyrean | 1.5% XP | Three Kingdoms | The Imperator + The Lord of Light + The Shadow | 1.5% XP | Three Paths | The Crafter + The Seeker + The Warrior | 1.5% XP | Three Powers | The Eternal + The Great Tree + The Indwelling | 1.5% XP Five Card Melds Icon | Solution | Cards Needed | Significator Used | Gateway: Master | 5x The Crafter | 4000 CXP | Gateway: Order and Chaos | The Eternal + The Imperator + The Indwelling + The Living Moon + The Shattered Moon | 3% XP | Gateway: Seeker in Darkness | The Eternal + The Indwelling + The Seeker + The Shadow + The Shattered Moon | 3% XP | Gateway: Seeker in Light | The Great Tree + The Imperator + The Living Moon + The Lord of Light \\+ The Seeker | 3% XP Twelve Card Melds Icon | Solution | Cards Needed | Significator Used | Deck of Power | The Crafter + The Eternal + The Great Tree + The Imperator + The Indwelling + The Living Moon + The Lord of Light + The Seeker + The Shadow + The Shattered Moon + The Warrior + Those Who Are Called | 7% XP | Gateway: Grandmaster | 12x The Crafter | 6938 CXP #### Fate Cards: If you use the Melds onto a Lesser Trump you will produce a Fate Card, Fate Cards basicly are a more powerful version of the lesser trumps, as in they give a buff but they are much more variant than just four specific ones. This allows you to be able to tailor a buff type your character is needing at higher levels. When using a Melded Deck onto a Lesser Trump the Med Deck is not consumed but the Lesser Trump is. Here is the breakdown. Icon | Meld | Added to lesser of type: | Output | Lesser | Normal | Greater | Duration | Twin Moons | | | Fortuna | Bad Luck | Better Luck | Best Luck | 30 Minutes | Three Kingdoms | | | Vigor | +75 Max Vigor | +150 Max Vigor | | 30 Minutes | Three Kingdoms | | | Health | +75 Max Health | +150 Max Health | | 30 Minutes | Three Kingdoms | | | Speed | Run Speed | | | 30 Minutes | Three Kingdoms | | | Frenzy | Attack Speed | | | 30 Minutes | Three Paths | | | Penetration | +1% Crit | +3% Crit | +5% Crit | 30 Minutes | Three Paths | | | Smithing | +10 Weapon Damage | +20 Weapon Damage | +30 Weapon Damage | 30 Minutes | Three Powers | | | Lightness | -6 CD | -8 CD | -10 CD | 30 Minutes | Three Powers | | | Protection | +6 AR | +8 AR | +10 AR | 30 Minutes | Deck of Power | | | Spirit Guard | +125 Max Health, +200 Max Vigor | +150 Max Health, +250 Max Vigor | +200 Max Health, +300 Max Vigor | 30 Minutes | Deck of Power | | | Eternal Flame | | +70 Attack Speed, +20 Run Speed | +100% Attack Speed, +30% Run Speed | 30 Minutes | Deck of Power | | | Warding | | +20 AR, -10 CD | | 30 Minutes | Deck of Power | | | Destruction | +40 Damage, +4% Crit | +50 Damage, +6% Crit | +60 Damage, +8% Crit | 30 Minutes **Credits:** Allen the Gimp - For guidance in the right direction for Gateway: The Plague * Navigate AC2Hero * Home * Crafting * Quests * Guides * Items * Maps * Search * News * Related Links * turbine.com * asheronscall.com * ac2wiki.info * ac2crafters.com * * * * * * * * * * Feedback * Terms of Use * About Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings (C) 2004-2013 Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. /// Copyright (C) 2013 AC2Hero.com", "metadata": {"source": "http://ac2hero.e5i5o.com/guides/tarot_melds.html", "title": "AC2Hero", "description": "Asheron's Call 2 Hero is the most complete source for Asheron's Call 2(2013).

You're learning. Now I want you to go kill a Monouga. Not one of those cursed undead ones either; I want you to kill a live one. Why? I told you before, don't ask, and when you're done, yeah, you know the drill--get back here FAST. Now... go!\"_ Quick, kill a Monouga! From Cavendo take the Shoushi portal near (15.7N, 26.1E), then take the Prosper Ringway (11.2N, 20.9E) to the Southern Prosper Outpost Here you will find just north of the drop off point, Undead Brutish Monouga. Return to Kanten (16.2N, 28.4E) in Cavendo to complete the quest and get your reward. Kanten tells you, _\" Amazing! You actually FOUND a Monouga? And here I thought they were all extinct... Oh well. You're not gonna like this... but there's a little problem. See, I have no funds right now to reward you right now. So why don't you just oh... come back in a week or so? Maybe I'll have a reward for you then. What? 2 hours? Time running out? What in Asheron's name are you talking about? There's no way I'm gonna have the reward in 2 hours. Sorry.

{"page_content": "Shapers Hoard Keys ### Quest Name: Shapers Hoard Keys **Requirements:** Level 1+ (Osteth), 15+ (Omishan), 30+ (Linvak Massif) **Reward:** Mined trait based key type, possible lodestones and tesserae **Time Limit:** 10 Minutes **Reset Timer:** 6 Days 20 Minutes per key type **Start Location** : Location dependant on name of Key, Keys can be found off a Prospector's Corpse that randomly spawn. **Walkthrough:** The Prospector's Corpses have been found on Osteth, Omishan, Linvak and Arramora. Loot the corpse to collect the key inside. | Shaper's <resourcetype> Hoard Key of <continent> Keys can be dropped, traded, or sold in Curiosity shops. The requirement to use the collected key is getting to the continent for that key, thus Omishan keys can only be done by level 15+ and Linvak by 30+. Each key corresponds to a Shaper's Hoard, and all 15 are on individual quest timers. While this can be done solo, the optimal way to do it is with a full fellowship of 9. However, if all 9 run in at once and mine, there won't be much ore to go around. The best way to run this quest with a full group is three groups of three. Osteth * Crystal: 38.0N 5.5W (Arwic) * Iron: 25.0N 29.6E (Northeast Drudge Citadel) * Silver: 2.6N, 13.8E (Eastern Prosper) * Stone: 17.8N 9.7W (Molwirth) * Wood: 40.5N, 19.5W (Millstone) Omishan * Crystal: 6.1N, 38.3E (Western Kydi) * Iron: 29.2N, 50.8E (Rakani) * Silver: 32.8N, 86.6E (Northeast Farali) * Stone: 15.0N, 88.3E (Northern Vesayen) * Wood: 5.7N, 64.3 E (Northern Lumari) Linvak * Crystal: 16.6S, 10.8W (Western Oriad) * Iron: 26.5S, 29.0W (Southwest Stoneshadow) * Silver: 13.2S, 41.3W (Northwest Nepeth) * Stone: 2.2S, 31.6W (Northeast Winterhollows) * Wood: 9.8S, 17.3W (Eastern Thusik) Using the key on the stockpile begins a 10 Minute quest. While this quest is active, anybody in the fellowship can click the hoard to enter the dungeon. Entering gives you a 5-minute \"buff\" which allows you to mine (independent of the 10-minute quest timer). Once that 5 minutes expires, you will lose the ability to mine and are portalled out of the dungeon. Shaper's Hoard Stockpile Map 1. The mines contain nodes of ore (3 uses each, like a normal node) 2. Nodes are on a fixed 2 minute respawn timer 3. Spawn location are fixed. Break your fellowship into three groups of 3 and one direction each (left, center or right). 1. Once the quest timer starts, only Group 1 enters the mine, and each person goes in their chosen direction. 2. When the quest timer reads 5:10, Group 2 enters the mine. Group 1 will be getting portalled out around this time. 3. When the quest timer reads 0:10, Group 3 enters the mine. Group 2 will be getting portalled out around this time. This allows all nine people to mine for a complete five minutes without having to fight for nodes. When you enter the mine you will be facing north, and from this entrance point you will go in the direction as the group you were assigned. Left will go East, Right will go West, Center will go North. Once inside do not stay stationary unless you are waiting on the respawn of your nodes. Mine a node and move to the next, continue this trend until your 5 minute timer runs out. When the timer runs out you will be teleported out of the dungeon. When the Quest timer completes its 10 minute cycle the quest will complete and you will be placed on a cool down for that key type. **Misc.

{"page_content": "Find My Idiot Son! ### Quest Name: Find My Idiot Son! **Requirements:** Level 40 **Reward:** % based XP: 2,503,673 XP Max cap **Time Limit:** 2 Hours **Reset Timer:** Unknown **Start Location** : Lord Stubbington III(8.7S, 52.6W), Eastern Gevoth Outpost **Walkthrough:** (Until quest is fixed this is all the info I have available) Lord Stubbington III tells you, _\"Greetings! I'm sure you're confused, so let me explain. My name is Lord Stubbington III, of the Linvak Stubbingtons. Even though I prefer to keep family business within the family, I need the help of a traveler -- and that's where you come in. Have you noticed how Stubby's always trying to get his hands on certain items? Eli Eyes and Onyx Wasp Honeycombs, to be specific? Well, the truth is, our family sells those things to Gurogs for their traditional battle-potions. Those potions can make you feel like a shreth with the strength of a warath! And not everyone thinks it's such a good idea to sell them to Gurogs. In fact, it's quite illegal. So it's a shady business, but it's treated our family well over the years, and Gurogs will be Gurogs. Lately, though, our Honeycombs have started to go missing. Stubby's the only one who could be taking them, and... well... I'm afraid he's become a honey addict. Now, I understand the need to explore new things. Even I took a dip of honey every now and then when I was young and stupid. But with Stubby, I think it's gone too far. It's his pants. He just doesn't keep track of his pants like he used to. When I tried to discuss his problem, he got angry and stormed off. He's been missing ever since, and I'm starting to fear that he'll do something dumb and hurt himself. Can you try to track my idiot son down? There's that Moose guy who makes Dillobells -- Stubby likes him a lot. If you want the job, that's the first place you should look.\"_ Travel to and speak with Moose Rickenson(19.7S, 31.2W) in Ondekodo Moose Rickenson tells you, _\"What's happening? Yeah, Stubby? He's a cool cat, but last time I saw him, he was pretty bummed out. He kept complaining about how his dad was trying to run his life, and then he started pestering me to make him some Dillobells. Of course I'd have been glad to, but I can't make Dillobells without Reaper Horns. He said he'd give me a honeycomb if I'd help him out, which is just crazy -- you can feed a Dillo with honey, but you can't make a Dillobell from it! Eventually he gave up and went off to chat with Gallus, his idol. Maybe Gallus would have a lead for you.\"_ Travel to and speak with Gallus(21.4S, 4.8W) in Whitebay Gallus tells you, _\"You're looking for who? Stubby? Oh, right, the autograph hound! I must've signed a hundred autographs for him. No idea what he does with them, but it's flattering. Yes, he dropped by just the other day. He seemed a little confused. He was babbling about Reaper Horns, and how pretty and shiny they are, and how happy he'd be if I could lend him some. He even offered me a nasty old honeycomb in trade! Of course, I don't keep things like that around. I told him I couldn't help, and he got angry. He said that if I wouldn't do a favor for a fellow Lugian, he'd go talk to the \"nice bunny man\" on Osteth instead. Maybe he did, but I haven't seen him since.\"_ Travel to and speak with Lahry(29.6N, 7.8W) east of Cragstone Lahry tells you, _\"You're not a rabbit! I like that! Sure, I'll chat for a while. Stubby? He's a buddy of mine, but I think he's been sick. Last time he dropped by, he looked exhausted, and he kept mumbling about wasps with horns. I suggested a nap in my house to freshen up, and I guess he needed it -- that boy slept for two days straight! When he finally woke up, I made him some pancakes, and he drizzled this weird- smelling honey all over them before wolfing them down. He was making a mess, so I went to work in my garden for a while. When I got back, all the pancakes were gone, and so was he! One other thing seemed really strange. I told him about a guy in Cragstone who sold me some cool vacation gear this summer. Stubby asked if he sold other things too, and then he got this weird look in his eyes. You might try asking that vendor if he's seen Stubby lately. Good luck! Beware the hopping horrors!\"_ Travel to and speak with Furs Turfna(31.9N_11.8W) in Cragstone. Furs Turfna tells you, _\"Hiya, buddy! Whatcha looking for? Hmm... Stubby, Stubby... is he a Lugian, about yea high? Sure, he was here recently. He looked through my inventory and wanted to buy some shades, but he didn't have any money. When I told him I wouldn't trade him anything for honeycombs, he got angry and shoved me. A pair of shades flew out of my pocket, and he grabbed them and ran away! I almost reported him to Officer Cameron, but then I felt sorry for the kid. They don't look kindly on lawbreakers in these parts, and he seemed more like a misguided young man than a real criminal. Before all the trouble, he asked if I knew of any nice beaches on Linvak, and I suggested the Water Walk. Used to go there all the time until the Gurog moved in. Hope you find him, and if you do, tell that boy to put on some pants!\"_ Travel to and speak with Stubby(26.1S, 37.7W), south of Southwest Nepeth Outpost, at The Water Walk. Stubby tells you, _\"Hey there! What? You work for my dad, don't you? I bet he's looking for me. Well, good! He doesn't treat me like an adult. Serves him right if he's worried. Honeycombs? What, you've got some? Oh, no, I don't have any myself. I think I left them wherever I left my pants. Don't you hate pants? They're so restricting! I prefer a nice breeze... especially around here, where it's so warm. Not snowy and cold like home. I'm done with that place! It's the beach for me! Yeah, as soon as I graduate from trade school, I'm moving out. Dad won't pay for sword-swinging school, so I'm thinking about helping Moose make his dillobells. I'll just bum around, maybe learn to play the lute. Anyway, this is where I'll be for a while. Tell my dad that if he wants to talk, he can march his fat, lazy butt down here. He won't, of course -- he hates warm weather and sand. He's so lame... and you can tell him I said so! Later.\"_ Return to Lord Stubbington III(8.7S, 52.6W) at Eastern Gevoth Outpost to report your findings and claim your reward. Lord Stubbington I I I tells you, _\"He's slacking off by the beach, huh? What a shocker. At least I know he's safe. Guess I'll give him some time by himself... you know how kids are. Thanks for your help. I'm sure Stubby's mother will be greatful as well.\"_ **Misc.

Evil has come to the heart of Osteth and now festers in the fabled ruins of Artefon. The remains of the greatest lords of the Golden Age were put to rest past the eastern banks of the River Artefon. After this season's events I fear for their sanctity. Please, journey east across the river, find the tombs, and report back to me. In return, I will pass on my knowledge of the arts required to create the Armor of the Ancient Lords, whose remains I send you now to investigate. Go now, I shall remain here and hope for happy news upon your return.\"_ You will now have to find the 6 tombs of each Lord along the eastern shore of the Lake Artefon basin. Tomb of Lord Aleval: 22.2N, 10.0E Tomb of Lord Aurutis: 21.8N, 8.1E Tomb of Lord Ralirea: 19.4N, 9.7E Tomb of Lord Shoyanen: 17.7N, 10.1E Tomb of Lord Tikauri: 15.9N, 10.4E Tomb of Lord Ulkas: 14.9N, 10.7E | After double clicking on each of the tombs, the quest info should update each time. Return and speak to Minauri (24.7N, 8.0E), near Rithwic Minauri tells you, _\"Tima was correct to bring me here. He has reported similar disturbances on the western shore of the river as well. The systematic desecration of Artefon's graves does not bode well for our future, my friend. I have too much to think about now, but before you leave, I will reward you as promised. A miner by the name of Ihipona recently claimed that she discovered the long lost Sapphire Mines of Ulkas, the great Master Smith. Word of her discovery traveled from the Shim Mountain Range near the Ariaki region - if you found her there, she may be able to help you find the sapphires to complete your armor. Another acquaintance, Orlen Jarlns, has found Shoyanen's lost method of imbuing sapphires. He is living near her old tower now.\"_ Now you will need to obtain 17 White Pyreals and 12 Sapphires To obtain 17 White Pyreals can be looted from Buruns or found on the ground around the Vesayan Isles and Farali Wastes. For Sapphires You can do this one of two ways. You can locate and kill the Undead Lords that randomly spawn around near the Lords tombs, they drop 1 ruby each, or you can go to the Sapphire Mines. To get to the Sapphire Mines you will need one White Pyreal to give to Ihipona (6.1N, 46.5E) east of the northern Kydi outpost. Give him the Ferrous Pyreal and enter the mines. There are 3 mines that you can mine from. Remember you need 12 Sapphires which is all you will be allowed to mine anyway from the quest Ihipona gives you. In most cases you may need a group or a high level player to join you to help clear the mine in this case you will need a White Pyreal for each of those members to enter the Mine. A note: If you open your Skills window, Crafting tab, scroll down to Quest Recipes you will see a section called Mines of Ulkas, inside you once you have given the pyreal, Click the Mine Emerald recipe. Select the mine and use the recipe to do the mining for you. This will allow multiple fellowship members to mine at the same time. Mining by just clicking on the mine will prevent you from mining if someone else is already in the process of doing so | White Pyreal | 1 to enter mine, 16 needed to make the armor, + one for each person to help in the mines not doing the quest | Sapphire | 12 needed to make the armor. You will need a Shadow Totem and Aconite for the next part of the quest, Shadow Totems are found from random drops or you can possibly find one in the Curiosities Shop in Cragstone or other major city. Aconite can be found in the Kydi Delta Region on the ground or purchased from a Curiosities Shop in one of the major cities. | Shadow Totem | 1 needed to give to Orlen Jarlns for Shoyanen's Solution Quest | Aconite | You will need a minimum of 5 maximum of 7 of these plants for the Shoyanen's Solution Quest, Once you have the Sapphires and the Shadow Totem you will need to make your way to Mayoi, Once you are in Mayoi travel southeast to Orlen Jarlns (5.7S 49.2E). Orlen Jarln tells you, _\"Greetings stranger. My former research led me here to the famed tower of Shoyanen Kenchu. Through my excavation near this tower I discovered her lost recipes for the infusions which allowed Master Smith Ulkas to imbue the gems of his Armor of the Ancients with magic beyond compare. As my scholarly focus includes many subjects, I also believe the objects within the Hoard of Chaos deserve further research. I am now willing to make an exchange - bring me a Shadow Totem, and I will give you my Alembic, instruct you in its use, and show you how to imbue the jewles from the Ulkas mines with power.\"_ You will need to hand him a Shadow Totem key to start the Shoyanen's Solutions quest. Orlen Jarln tells you, _\"Thank you! There has been a small amount of geothermal activity in the lesser isles of western Ariaki, eastern Lumari, and the Mist Curl Vale of Oriad. Fill up this Alembic with Mineral Water from one of the Geysers that have sprung up in each of these areas. Combine the Aconite flowers that grow here in the Kydi Delta and the Ariaki River Delta with this Mineral Water into an infusion and give it to me for inspection. I will then show you how to imbue jewels from the Ulkas mines with magic. Keep in mind that the water flowing from each of these regions is subtly different, and when combined with Aconite will yeild a different type of infusion.\"_ Orlen Jarln gives you a Glass Alembic which will be used to collect the waters for the solution | Glass Alembic Travel to the Coralen Geyser (27.5N, 89.4E). You can reach this area from Orlen Jarln's location by travelling back to Mayoi and taking the Gateway to Ikeras(4.5S, 44.5E), once you have traveled through the gateway travel northeast tothe portal to Rakani(10.4N, 61.1E), once in Rakani take the portal to Ankoro(27.0N, 55.8E), once in Ankoro take the portal to the Farali Ringway(29.7N, 71.7E) follow the ringway until you reach the Northeast Farali Outpost, from here travel to the Coralen Geyser (27.5N, 89.4E) Hand the Alembic in your inventory to the Coralen Gyser to get Waters of Coralen. | Waters of Coralen Use the quest recipe to create a Infusion of Aconite. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. You will need to repeat this process until you have 9 Decoction of Aconite. | Infusion of Aconite | 13 Infusion of Aconite are needed(12 for the Sapphires, and 1 to complete the Shoyanen's Solution quest). Once you have all 13 return to Orlen Jarlns(5.7S 49.2E) southeast of Mayoi. Hand him one Infusion of Aconite to complete the Shoyanen's Solution quest. He will then give you the recipe needed to imbue the Sapphires. Each Sapphire will need to be imbued with one Infusion of Aconite. You can find the recipe in your Skills window, Craft tab, Quest Recipes. Use the recipe to create 12 Imbued Sapphires Orlen Jarlns tells you, _\"Good job! I shall reserve this infusion for my future research, but take this recipe. I hear the fabled sapphire mines of Ulkas have been discovered by a woman named Ihipona in the Mountain Range near the Ariaki region. This recipe will help you imbue the sapphires from these mines with magical properties that have been lost to the world until now. Good luck in your travels, adventurer.\"_ | Imbued Sapphire You will now be able to create your armor with the combination of the 12 Imbued Sapphires and the 16 White Pyreals by using the recipes given to you.

In ages past, the Darkener family was powerful in the councils of the Shadow Kingdom, and we were entrusted with many ancient magics. The Archons somehow learned of this, and came to my brother Marak, and demanded the arcane secrets. When he refused, they summoned up an Empowered Warath which slew Marak's wife and young children, forever severing their lifestone bindings. Marak swore revenge, and using mighty spells, created a sword into which he placed all the hatred of his impassioned soul. He intended to slay the vile Warath, but the enchantment finally weakened his frame, and I fear he lies dead in the beast's dark dungeon. Please, find the sword, slay the Warath, and return it to me so that I may free my brother's tormented soul. I must warn you, the power of the sword is such that it will weigh terribly on your shoulder until you return it to me; you had best go with friends who will be able to protect you after the beast is slain.

Perhaps it is mad.\"_ Scully Vinco flinches as if expecting an attack from the Skyport. You received the item from Scully Vinco: Journal of Dianech Uscari _\"Something happened here long ago... We need to find out what. If you help in this endeavor I will reward you.\" \"This book reports on what we know thus far, which is not much. The Skyport is named after Emperor Caerlin II and was built by Dianech Uscari, an Empyrean architect/builder. Dianech was killed in an accident involving one of the southeast defense crystals.\" \"A student of mine is doing research in this region. His name is Wiamli Bigson and he was supposed to report to me a while ago. He is overdue. Perhaps you could go find him, he was staying in the settlement south of here?\"_ | First part of Dianech Uscari's Journal ! You can skip travelling to the southern city of Yeosenji as there is no quest advancement for doing so: If you head south to the nearest town Yeosenji and speak to people there they have not seen him. Up the hill in the town you will speak to a woman named Tretna Byer who tells you the following. Tretna Byer tells you, _\"The last I know of him he headed towards a mine he said he'd discovered.

There is a structure on an island northwest of here which an explorer reported may be a residence of Dianech Uscari. You may find some way to unseal this there.\"_ Travel to the Mansion(26.3S, 25.2E), located on the island to the northwest of Skyport Once inside kill and loot every Skyport Servitor you come across, each member of your fellowship will need a Study Key to proceed onward. | Study Key Skyport Mansion Map Once everyone has a key continue into the Study and hand the Sealed Book to the Damaged Servitor.

Double-click the Transference Crystal in your inventory and use it on the Skyport Nexus Heart. Your quest will advance. _You place the Transfer Crystal to the surface of the Nexus Heart crystal and hear a low hum. The hum then dissipates and the Transfer crystal disintegrates into a pile of dust. A voice in your mind says, \"... dissipating... My mind is clearer..._ Return to Scully Vinco (30.6S, 34.7E) on Caerlin Skyport, and hand him the three Journals and complete the quest. Scully Vinco tells you, _\"Thus the Skyport was built with ego, loss, madness and death. It appears Dianech\u2019s death was no accident. Much to ponder... not all is solved.\" \"Another day perhaps... my own family awaits.\" \"Thank you, I understand more now. There was much unhappiness in this endeavor.\"_ **Misc.

He will ask you to bring him 3 artifacts from each kingdom. You will have to steal those for him from the kingdom's security. This quests has 3 parts, one for each kingdom artifact. You will have to return some times to the dark agent so its very usefull if you use the Lifestone near him (the same one for HoD) or one summoner in fellow uses it and allows all fellow to recall here. **Part I - Order: Scroll of the Deeping Well** The Dark Agent will give you a key that you can use to teleport to the Order kingdom's Scriptorium. Inside you will need to fight the Scriptorium Guards and Scribes that will attack you. Keep moving foward and cross the Scribes room. Across the room there is a tunnel and after that you will arrive to a big room with a stairway. Go up stairs and at top the guards will defend the Scroll of the Deeping Well.

Inside just speak to the first Virindi Monitor Welcomer and gain access to the Virindi Museum. This room is similar to Virindi Training Dungeon and you will have to fight the Virindi Caretakers Guardians (level 50 solo monsters).

Give the Lens to the Dark Agent to advance the quest. | Lens of Perception **Part III - Shadow: Codex of Shadows** Shadow Vault Map You must now enter the Shadow Vault, so go Speak to Naokim (in the Shadow Antechamber in Ikeras) and talk to him several times until he will port you to the Vault. In the Vault you will fight Several Shadow Protectors. In the shadow tunnels, take first right, and then left until you see a big room with three doors. Jump down near the doors. You need to go to the end of the middle door but you need to \"solve\" the opening combination of the levers. The path you need to go will start by the leftmost door, but you need to use the first 3 levers to open it (check map bellow). _An important note:_ you can use both levers outside and inside the doors to open the left door. We can't confirm yet but it seams that using all outside levers and the middle one inside will open the left door. When left door is open you will be able to get inside and enter a small room with a chest, a lever and a shadow guard. Kill the guard and them use the lever inside that room. A lot of doors will open and you need to run until you arrive to another room with lever. Just keep doing this until you get to the middle row top door. The Codex of Shadows is located there and near the level 55 shadow \"boss\" (still a solo monster). | Codex of Shadows If you can, open the many Vault Chests you will find here. These chests often contain good loot (huge gems), and you can never return here once completing the quest. You can only open around 12 Vault Chests per character. Once you steal the Codex (again all in fellow need one), hand it to the Dark Agent to complete the Path of Darkness quest and gain your XP.

I perceive you wish to visit Dominion Center. We are always willing to display the splendor of the Singularity to prospective citizens.\"_ Virindi Training Map After you enter take the path on the left if you look to your right hand side you will see a portal fairly close to you click it to select it and step back to get running distance jump off the passage towards this portal and press your \"USE\" key (default is \"F\" on your keyboard) as soon as you get close to it. IF your attempt is unsuccessful you may be better off continuing down the path and jumping down from the top onto the various platforms making your way to the portal. Once you enter the portal you will be teleported to the Neonate Training Ground, you will see three passages the one to the Right takes you to the Green and Blue Courses, the Left passage takes you to the Red and Yellow Courses. Directly infront of you is the goal of this area but you must complete the four courses to enter it. #### **1\\. Yellow Buff** Run left, take left passage once at the end jump off the end onto the passage below. You will find your way to four levels with 5x5 platforms. The Squares have a pattern on them the ones you walk on as you approach the levels have the same pattern as the solid squares on the first level. your jump distance has been increased and it is advised you account for this when jumping from platform to platform. Make your way using the floor pattern until you reach the portal on the opposite side. this will teleport you to the next level upward. the next few levels work the same way but the path to the portal will change at each level. Use the pattern on the platform you enter on as the guide for the pattern you need to stay on. the middle two levels are the hardest as the platforms clarity is obscure with the levels below them. Once you reach the top make your way to the final portal use it to get to the Yellow Portal to recieve the Yellow Buff. | Yellow #### **2\\. Red Buff** Run left, take right passage. Jump to the platform below, use the portal on this platform to access the Red Portal for your Red Buff. | Red #### **3\\. Blue Buff** Run right, take right passage. You'll see several platforms one above another with green and red portals. They all have a wall on the back side of them except one, that one is your goal. Randomly use the portals red and green untill you get to the platform without the wall. Jump to the platform below take the portal, it will put you on the platform to get your Blue Buff by using the Blue Portal. | Blue #### **4\\. Green Buff** Run right, take right passage. You will see 4 blue portals next to each other with a 5th portal a bit higher on the left. The 5th portal is your goal. Directly infront of you is the portal you will need to use to start the trial. Select this portal and zoom out (far enough that you can still move and see what is going on) and place your camera looking down onto your character. Do not run into the portal, use your \"USE\" key (default is the \"F\" key) to enter the portal. Not using your \"USE\" key will make you miss the portal you are trying to fall down into. Once you enter the portal you will fall directly down into another portal(the one on the far right) and this process will continue until you reach the portals on the left side. as this is happening do your best to select the 5th portal. you can do this by clicking on it in the main window or by selecting it on your Radar. As soon as you fall down the 4th time use your USE key again to enter the last portal to access the Green Portal for your Green Buff and be teleported back to the start point once more. | Green From the start point once you have all four buffs walk straight ahdead you will see a row of portals a color for each of the buffs you have attained. walk through them and you will see a Purple Portal, walk into it to be taken to the next trial in the Purple Section. This is a low-gravity area more so than the previous. It will take some getting used to the jump distance aswell as the timing. When possible jump diagonally as this gives you more room to land. _DO NOT attack the red virini monitors or jump onto the same platform as them._ The yellow neonates are attackable and one shotable, this will help you clear your way in many cases. when jumping from one platform to another not diagonally jump from as far back on the platform as possible. Always press the walk backwards key after a jump as your character will tend to continue to move forward upon landing. Work you're way trough to the obstacle to the platform on the opposite corner from the start location. Enter the portal to the Imperatorial Court and speak to Imperator Thromer Olvidan to complete the quest. Imperator Thromer Olvidan tells you, _\"Congratulations on your completion of the Neonate Virindi Training course.

{"page_content": "The Art of Growing Dye Plants ### The Art of Growing Dye Plants (aka How to follow a chart to make pretty colors) By: Spazmeister To begin your journey to become a grower of dye plants, choose your favorite means of recall to Cragstone and head East out of town to the lonely homestead of Regani (32.0N, 10.5W). Regani will be your one stop shop for all your dye needs from now until the end of time. Oddly enough, she only sells 6 items which is more than enough for you to make any color dye that exists in the game. First, let\u2019s look at Regani\u2019s Guide to Dye Plant Cultivation, which is a quick, down and dirty explanation of how the dye plant growing process works. _\u201cFor many years I have been studying the various flora used in the dyeing of clothing and armor and have been frustrated at the rarity of these plants in nature. That being the case, I have devoted myself to the art of cultivating these plants and, after many failed attempts, I have finally perfected the art! This small guide will explain to you how you too can grow dye plants._ _First, you will need to get a seed. The seeds that I offer are very special though, and can only be planted in the rich soil surrounding my humble cabin. Although this may feel very limiting, do not fear! The enchantments allow the plant to mature at an astonishing rate. Why within a few minutes of being planted, you'll have a dye plant in full bloom!_ _After the seed has been planted, you will need to give it constant attention! The plant will need to be watered or fertilized almost constantly. If you fail to give your plant the attention it needs, your plant will die!_ _Once your plant has reached full maturity, you will be able to harvest it._ _ You may notice in cultivating your plant that it is covered in pollen. This pollen is very useful in creating hybrid plants! Feel free to experiment with this pollen and see what you can create!\u201d_ _~ Regani\u2019s Guide to Dye Plant Cultivation_ **The Basics** Let\u2019s look at how the process actually works. There are 3 different components of a dye plant: The dye seed (You will always start with a seed) The dye pollen (The pollen is where the magic happens) The dye plant (This is what you have after) We are going to start with growing your first dye plant First, you need to purchase a Watering Can* and a Bag of Fertilizer*. Each item has an initial durability of 100/100. That means you can water a plant 100 times or fertilize a plant 100 times. Once the durability reaches 0, the item will vanish from your inventory. This isn\u2019t really a big deal since the cost of these 2 items is relatively nothing. Before moving on, put the watering can and the bag of fertilizer onto your action bar. This will make the process considerably easier, allowing you to grow upwards of 4+ plants at a time once you become proficient in the process. (*Watering Cans or Bags of Fertilizer do not stack on each other. Don\u2019t buy more than you need!) Now it\u2019s time to start growing a dye plant. Go back to Regani and purchase a dye seed. It doesn\u2019t matter which one, we are just learning the process. Now, find an area with some space (you can only grow dye plants inside the small fenced in area Regani has established) and double click the seed. The seed will now be planted and look like a miniature version of its full grow self you would find out in the world. Click on the tiny plant and examine it. | There are 4 parts of the examination window that we are interested in following. 1. Water 2. Fertilizer 3. Pollen 4. Plant Maturity First one we will talk about is Plant Maturity. All plants take 3 minutes to reach maturity. All you have to do is keep the seedling from dying in a 3 minute window. Next is Pollen. This is what you will use to change the color of the plant further down the road. We will talk more in detail about this later. For now, you can safely ignore the Pollen field. Now on to Water and Fertilizer. These work identically to each other. The water and fertilizer fields have 6 values. None Needed Needed Badly Needed Urgently Needed Desperately Needed Death Imminent! When initially planted, all plants start at \u2018Badly Needed\u2019 in both fields. The status of each field will degrade randomly over time working down to \u2018Death Imminent!\u2019 All you have to do to successfully grow a plant is to keep it from dying. To do this, press the action key associated with your watering can or bag of fertilizer and when the target icon appears, click the plant. That is the whole process. The Water and Fertilizer fields do not have to be in the \u2018None Needed\u2019 state for the plant to mature, and the status of these 2 fields has no impact on the results from the plant maturing. This is either a pass (Mature Plant) or fail (You killed the plant) endeavor. Now that the dye plant has reached maturity, pick it up from the ground and rejoice! If you were paying attention, you will notice that in addition to the plant, you also picked up pollen from that plant. Keep that for later, you\u2019ll need it. Congratulations! You now know how to grow Red, Dark Green, and Brown dye plants. No more searching the world for dye plants in the wild to dye your armor with. Wait... What\u2019s that you say? You want to grow different color dye plants? NO PROBLEM! Remember the Pollen you picked up from your first dye plant? Now it\u2019s time to play MAD SCIENTIST!!! Actually, we\u2019re just going to be botanists. **Look ma! I\u2019m a botanist!** Head back to Regani and buy another seed, this time purchasing one you didn\u2019t use before. Make sure you still have plenty of durability left on your Watering Can and Bag of Fertilizer. Find yourself another section of open real estate and plant that seed. Follow the same procedures as before except this time, double click the pollen you had from the previous plant and use it on the seedling you just planted. Notice how the pollen field changed from none to the formal name of the color of the pollen you used? Now keep watering and fertilizing the plant until it matures. Once it is done, pick up the plant and rejoice in your handy work! You\u2019ve just discovered a new colored plan\u2026 errrr, seed? So you discovered a new color seed. In fact, I bet you discovered 3 seeds. In fact I bet I can figure out what color seeds you discovered, assuming you purchased a different color seed this time. If you didn\u2019t buy a different color seed, you received 3 seeds of the same color. You planted a\u2026 | You pollenated with\u2026 | You received\u2026 Dark Green Seed | Red Pollen | 3 Light Green Seeds Dark Green Seed | Brown Pollen | 3 Bronze Seeds Red Seed | Dark Green Pollen | 3 Light Green Seeds Red Seed | Brown Pollen | 3 Gold Seeds Brown Seed | Red Pollen | 3 Bronze Seeds Brown Seed | Dark Green Pollen | 3 Gold Seeds By now, I\u2019m sure you are wondering \u201cHow on earth did you know what color seeds I received and how many?\u201d Well the answer is simple. I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve done it a whole lot. So much in fact, that I made a spreadsheet. Would you like to see it? I bet you would. TA-DAA! ***Acromatin removes all dye from a piece of armor. At this point I\u2019m sure you are looking at that chart and thinking \u201cWhat the hell does all that mean?\u201d Ok, let\u2019s break this down into some detail. **Time to get Jiggy with it** Step 1: Keep Calm Before we go over the chart, let\u2019s cover some important facts: Growing 1 plant from a seed will ALWAYS give 1 dye plant and 1 pollen of that color 1 Red Seed = 1 Red dye plant and 1 Red pollen 1 Black Seed = 1 Black dye plant and 1 Black pollen Growing 1 plant from a seed and pollenating it will ALWAYS give seeds Black, Pink, Orange and Acromatin Seeds are the exception. Pollenate these seeds at your own risk. I haven\u2019t tried it and I don\u2019t recommend you try it. All that being said, let\u2019s look at the chart again. Any seed color you start with and then pollenate will always produce seeds. Let\u2019s say we want to make Gold dye plants. For that we need Gold seeds. From scratch, Gold can be made in 2 ways. Red seeds with Brown pollen and Brown seeds with Dark Green pollen. We\u2019re going to focus on the first example. To make Gold dye seeds we need to purchase 1 Red seed and 1 Brown seed. Since we need to pollenate the Red seed with Brown pollen, we will grow the Brown seed first. Once the Brown seed is grown, you have 1 Brown dye plant and 1 Brown pollen. Since the pollen is all we are interested in, you can sell the plant, or give it away, or trash it. Now, plant the Red seed and pollenate it with Brown and let the seed mature. You now have 3 Gold seeds. Now you are free to take those 3 Gold seeds and run from there. **Tips and Tricks** _Always plan ahead before you start making dye plants. _ Failure to plan ahead can result in too many seeds of one color and not enough pollen of another. Planning ahead also allows you to use all of your builder colors (i.e. colors used to make other colors) instead of having some left over. _Work backwards_ If you know you want Black dye and you only need 4 of the plants, work backwards from 4 Black dye seeds. This will minimize loss and allow you to know how much to buy up front. _Don\u2019t forget about that high level pollen_ Just because you shouldn\u2019t pollenate Black seeds doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use Black pollen to your advantage. Look at the chart and see what you can do with Black pollen before you decide it\u2019s worthless. _Efficiency is key_ When I make dye for my characters, I don\u2019t do it 1 plant at a time. I\u2019ll make 4-5 plants at a time to keep things moving. Besides, 3 minutes takes a long time to pass when you have 1 plant growing. When you are growing 5, 3 minutes passes in a matter of seconds. _Growing dye plants isn\u2019t as expensive as you think_ For 4k gold, I can make 6 Black dye plants.

{"page_content": "### Quest Name: Asheron's Crypt **Requirements:** Level 55+, completed Crypt Keys II **Reward:** % based XP - 11% needed to level **Time Limit:** 10 Hours **Reset Timer:** None **Start Location** : Action based quest, no quest starter. **Walkthrough:** A small fellowship should be used to attempt this dungeon due to the few Group Class creatures and the small groups that randomly spawn. Make your way to and enter the Crypt Entrance. Your task is to find six Chroma Spheres (Yellow, Green, Cyan, Red, Magenta, and Blue) located in Crypt Chests throughout the dungeon loot each as you find them. These are needed for the final puzzle and to maximize your XP. Besure to now that the dungeon has many traps, these traps can spawn up to four (Level 60-65 Solo Class) undead some of which have armor-peircing abilities. These traps can originate from picking up a key, opening a chest, or by just walking into a room. Keep your Fellowship at max health at all times. | Red Chroma Sphere | Green Chroma Sphere | Blue Chroma Sphere | Cyan Chroma Sphere | Magenta Chroma Sphere | Yellow Chroma Sphere Enter the crypts then head left towards the east until you see the dot for the Brass Crypt Key on radar. Pick up this key. | Brass Crypt Key Once you have the first key head west until you reach a large room full of skeletons, chests, and a Gold Crypt Key. \"IGNORE THIS KEY\", it has no use. You will see two exits from this room on the same wall. A northern exit and a southern exit. Take the south exit and take the southeast hall to a locked door, which the Brass Crypt Key will unloack. Pick-up The Silver Crypt Key that is behind this door. | Silver Crypt Key Once you have the Silver Crypt Key, go to the northwest hallway here in the southern section. Near the end of the hall you will find locked gate and a Crypt Guardian. Use the Silver Crypt Key on this gate (the Crypt Guardian has a chance to open it for you). Once on the other side pick-up the Iron Crypt Key. Return to the Gold Crypt Key Room, again \"IGNORE THE KEY\". | Iron Crypt Key Take the northern exit out of this room. Travel north to another locked door. Use the Iron Crypt Key on this door, on the other side of the door you will find a Bronze Crypt Key, pick it up. By this point you should have found and looted several Crypt Chests during your exploration and have collected all six Chroma Sheres. If you do not have all six continue exploring and looting chest until you do. | Bronze Crypt Key Once you have all six Chroma Spheres head to the Gold Crypt Key room again. Head to the east where you found the first key. There is a locked door with a lever behind it the Bronze Crypt Key opens this door. Let your Fellowship know that they must not move slow and to stay close at all times once the lever is pulled. Pull the lever, and run to the area where you first entered the crypts. Turn left and through the door at the far end which should now be open because of the lever. If the door is closed, you will need to back track and attempt the run once more. This new area is a maze of gates, select the gates to find out which can be opened and which ones will not. A Vengeful Ghost (unkillable, Invisible unless targeted) inhabits this area he will attack and annoy you as you progress through the maze. Make your way north, and enter the Chromatic Door. Inside the Chromatic Room you will find a six sided star, the points of the star are colored the same six colors of your Chroma Sheres, the center is rainbow colored. To simplify this puzzel the task is to hand Chroma Spheres to the colored triangles to get them into certain color patterns around the star, once all the points are in the correct color orders you will double click the points in the correct order to gain a reward (the chroma sheres are not consumed during this process). Six solutions are known matching the six chroma, each one grants XP and loot from a Realaidain Chest. After each solution, loot the chest and enter the \"Back to Crypts\" portal to return to the Chromatic Door. The points of the star will revert to their original colors after a minute or two. Once all six have been done enter the puzzle room and click the center of the star to finish and receive your reward. Solution | 1\\. Red | 2\\. Green | 3\\. Blue | 4\\. Cyan | 5\\. Magenta | 6\\.

Are you here to study the Temple of Elemental Light? Silly me, of course you are!\"_ _\" Here, I'll give you permission to enter the site.\"___ *IMPORTANT NOTE:_the portal to the Dungeon only opens during Daytime._ Swim to the island Southeast of the Quest Starter where the Temple structure is. At the Temple Structure there are six pillars around a Central Pillar in middle of the Temple structure. You must unlock the pillars in the correct sequence then the Central Pillar will open the portal to the Dungeon. Its better for only 1 member of the fellow to click the outter pillars to open the portal to avoid reseting by mistake. Touch a outter pillar to unlock it and then never touch it again until the sequence is done. If you touch it again they will reset and you will need to start from the beginning. The Central Pillar will give you information on what is happening so the best way to unlock them is to use one outter pillar at a time and then check the Central Pillar for information. When you clicked the correct one the Central Pillar will say that ONE of the light will be \"set\". That pillar is now ready and you now need to only click the others until all 6 are \"set\".

Down this path you need to find lever D (see map) and then proceed to (E) and (F) to enter the Dark Lattice Room. Inside the room each fellow member needs to pick up one dark lattice. now use levers the reverse order until you get back to door (C). If you get lost or cant find the levers just recall and open the dungeon portal again. | Dark Lattice From door (C) you now need to go to the well of elemental light room and for that you need to open doors (G) and (H). The best way is to open door G then 2 or 3 members of fellow stay inside near the inner (G) lever. The rest of group go open the (H) door. When its open 1 or 2 from the members inside (G) enter last room and stay at H lever in case door closes. Open (G), Open (H) and all members enter.
