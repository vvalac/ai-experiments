In response, Zuckerberg screenshotted a reply advising Musk to start training and said \"send me location\", in apparent reference to Russian mixed martial artist Khabib Nurmagomedov, who challenged Conor McGregor using the same words. After The Verge published its story on the encounter, Musk said, \"Vegas Octagon\", referring to the events facility UFC Apex in Enterprise, Nevada. Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) president Dana White said that both men are \"dead serious\" about the fight.

The book was published on September 12, 2023, by Simon & Schuster.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nElon Musk first announced that Isaacson was in the process of writing his biography in August 2021. He revealed that Isaacson had shadowed him \"for several days so far\".Isaacson followed Musk for the next two years, visiting his SpaceX and Tesla factories and attending board meetings. The book is the result of hours of interviews with Musk and his family, friends, colleagues and adversaries. Isaacson was present when Musk decided to buy Twitter and to run his new AI company; Musk also shared messages from the Ukrainian minister Mykhailo Fedorov, and some were included in the book.

Musk denied the allegation, saying satellites in the region were not turned on, and that he chose not to activate them. The biography claim prompted several allegations against Musk for deliberately disrupting the operation. Isaacson later retracted his claim as a mistake, as Crimea had no Starlink coverage prior to the attack similarly to other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.The Washington Post, which had published Isaacson\\'s opinion piece, corrected that \"after the publication of this adaptation, the author learned that his book mischaracterized the attempted attack by Ukrainian drones on the Russian fleet in Crimea. Musk had already disabled (\"geofenced\") coverage within 100 km of the Crimean coast before the attack began, and when the Ukrainians discovered this, they asked him to activate the coverage, and he refused.\" The Guardian and CNN also added a footnote to correct the claim.Isaacson corrected his claim and clarified that Elon Musk said that the policy to not allow Starlink to be used for an attack on Crimea had been implemented earlier than the night of the Ukrainian attack, while Ukrainians did not know about it. Ukrainian general Kyrylo Budanov declared being \"not sure that Elon Musk operated some mythical buttons and stopped the movement of some devices. This is my personal opinion. The fact that the Starlink systems did not work for a certain time near the Crimea, I can absolutely confirm, because we also used a certain technique. We immediately realized that there is simply no coverage there\".\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nAhead of its publication, the book topped Amazon\\'s bestseller list. It debuted at number one on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for the week ending September 16, 2023.At the review aggregator website Book Marks, the book had an overall rating of \"mixed\", based on 15 book reviews from mainstream literary critics.The New York Times critic Jennifer Szalai wrote, \"Isaacson [...] is a patient chronicler of obsession; in the case of Musk, he can occasionally seem too patient.\"Brian Merchant of the Los Angeles Times criticized Isaacson\\'s \"great man\" biography format as extremely dated and took issue with his persistent framing of Musk as a \"moody but brilliant world-mover\", writing, \"The author will unearth unflattering personal anecdotes and share stories about the subject\\'s capacity to be cruel.

The service uses ADS-B data, publicly available records, to give general information about where and when Musk\\'s private jet was taking off and landing, though it cannot indicate who is on board or where the passengers travel before or after the flight. The Twitter account in particular became a reliable way for Musk\\'s investors, fans, and critics to determine his whereabouts, often between the Austin area where he lives, the San Francisco Bay area where Tesla\\'s factory is, and Southern California, where SpaceX is headquartered.As of July 2023, the ElonJet service is hosted on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Threads, Mastodon, and Bluesky accounts. The Mastodon account was created on December 14, 2022, a day after the original Twitter account was suspended. Sweeney has earned a few thousand dollars with the accounts, via ad revenue, allowing him to upgrade his computer. A subreddit dedicated to the service, r/ElonJetTracker, gained over 40,000 members in the two days since it was created on December 14, becoming one of the fastest-growing subreddits on the website.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe ElonJet Twitter account was started in June 2020 by Florida student Jack Sweeney. At the time, he was a high school senior, with his education suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Sweeney considered himself a fan of Musk\\'s work at SpaceX and Tesla, leading him to start the account.Elon Musk has had issues with the account for a long time, and offered Jack Sweeney $5,000 to delete the account in 2021. Sweeney countered asking for $50,000, saying he would use the money for college and possibly to buy a Tesla Model 3. Their last exchange was in January 2022, when Musk said it wouldn\\'t feel right to pay in order to shut the account down. Sweeney asked about the possibility of an internship at one of Musk\\'s companies, and offered Musk advice, including about a federal privacy program to vary the ID his transponder beamed out, thus blocking flight tracking programs. Musk began using the program, though Sweeney remained able to track Musk\\'s flights.

Davis was one of the earliest hires at SpaceX (in 2003) and has twin master\\'s degrees in particle physics and aerospace engineering.In November 2020, TBC announced hiring for positions in Austin, Texas, and by December 2020 had leased two buildings in a 14-acre (5.7 ha) industrial complex northeast of Austin, approximately 16 miles (26 km) north of Texas Gigafactory.On April 20, 2022, the company announced an additional $675 million Series C funding round, valuing the company at approximately $5.675 billion. The round was led by Vy Capital and Sequoia Capital, with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Founders Fund, 8VC, Craft Ventures, and DFJ Growth. Sometime before April 2023, the company moved their headquarters and engineering facilities to Bastrop, Texas.Currently, tunnels connecting different parts of the LVCC are open, and a tunnel to Resorts World started operating in July 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Tunnel boring machines ==\\nThe first boring machine utilized by The Boring Company was Godot, a conventional TBM made by Lovat. The company would later design their own line of machines called Prufrock. Engadet reported that the Prufrock-2, which was unveiled in August 2021, could dig up to a mile per week, whereas its successor, the Prufrock-3 is planned to dig up to seven miles per day.\\n\\n\\n== Tunnels ==\\n\\n\\n=== Hawthorne test tunnel ===\\n\\nTBC built a 1.14-mile (1.83 km) high-speed tunnel in 2017 on a route in Hawthorne, California, at the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility. The tunnel roadway has an asphalt surface, a guide-way for autonomous vehicle operation, and supports car trips at speeds of 90 mph (140 km/h) with autonomous control and up to 116 mph (187 km/h) under human control.\\n\\n\\n=== Las Vegas Convention Center ===\\n\\n\\n==== Convention Center ====\\nIn May 2019, the company w', metadata={'title': 'The Boring Company', 'summary': 'The Boring Company (TBC) is an American infrastructure, tunnel construction services, and equipment company founded by Elon Musk.

Tad Hirsch, a student and activist associated with the Ruckus Society, the Institute for Applied Autonomy, and later the MIT Media Lab, built the basic first application to help activists organize protests at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Inspired by TXTmob and other SMS sharing applications of the day, members of the podcasting company Odeo had an \"all-day brainstorming session\" to decide on building a new application. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student, claims to have introduced the group to the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter. The developers initially considered \"10958\" as the service\\'s short code for SMS text messaging, but later changed it to \"40404\" for \"ease of use and memorability\". Work on the project started in February 2006. Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. PST (UTC−08:00): \"just setting up', metadata={'title': 'Twitter', 'summary': 'X, commonly referred to by its former name Twitter, is a social media website based in the United States.

She attended Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario and obtained a degree in English literature. \\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter college, Wilson moved to Japan, teaching English as a second language (ESL). She subsequently settled in California.Wilson is the author of the contemporary fantasy novel BloodAngel, published in 2005 by the Roc Books imprint of Penguin Books. Her second book, Uninvited, was released in 2007 and is an unrelated work intended for young-adult readers. A sequel to BloodAngel, Lord of Bones, was released in 2008. Musk was one of the first people to use a site like Pinterest to plan out a novel.In a 2007 interview, she identified Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates, Paul Theroux, George R.R. Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, and Neil Gaiman as authors to whom she could relate her writings. She also described her books as cross-genre fiction.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn January 2000, Wilson married Elon Musk. Their first child was born in 2002 and died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks. Through in vitro fertilization, she gave birth to twins in 2004 and to triplets in 2006. On September 13, 2008, she announced that she and Musk were getting a divorce. She and Musk share custody of their children.Wilson later wrote an article for Marie Claire detailing ways she thought the marriage was unhealthy, such as Musk\\'s dismissal of her career ambitions, his description of himself as the \"alpha\" in the relationship, and his pressure for her to become a trophy wife. In 2010, she described herself as a \"model former wife\", and said she was on good terms with Musk\\'s then-wife, Talulah Riley.She has stated that she kept the last name Musk for the sake of their children. In 2022, one of their twins officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity, and took Wilson as her surname because she no longer wished to be associated with her father.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website \\nJustine Musk at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database', metadata={'title': 'Justine Musk', 'summary': 'Jennifer Justine Musk (née Wilson; born September 2, 1972) is a Canadian author.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Musk'}), Document(page_content='Jack Sweeney (born c.\\u20092002) is an American programmer and entrepreneur.

Sweeney would use flight-tracking data to track his father coming home when he commuted from Dallas back to Florida.In the beginning of 2022, Sweeney was a freshman at the University of Central Florida, and was studying information technology. He intends to work in software engineering. In February 2022, Sweeney stated in an interview with Bloomberg Wealth that he was establishing a company called \"Ground Control\" that monitors flight activity of prominent billionaires.\\n\\n\\n=== Creation of flight monitoring tools ===\\nAs a teenager, Sweeney developed Twitter bots to track and share the locations of the private jets of several individuals including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, and Drake. His program uses public data sources including the Federal Aviation Administration, OpenSky Network, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast. In June 2020, he created the \"Elon Musk\\'s Jet\" Twitter account, dedicated to tracking Musk\\'s private jet by using bots that scrape publicly available air traffic data.During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweeney began tweeting the location of approximately 30 private jets belonging to Russian oligarchs. In a March 2022 interview with CBS MoneyWatch, Sweeney stated his desire to see their planes seized. Some oligarchs being tracked include Vladimir Putin, Len Blavatnik, Roman Abramovich, Alexander Abramov, Dmitry Rybolovlev, Arkady Rotenberg, Eugene Shvidler, Vladimir Potanin, Vagit Alekperov, Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Prokhorov, Alisher Usmanov, Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Mikhelson, Viktor Medvedchuk, Vladimir Lisin, Suleyman Kerimov, Oleg Tinkov, Yuri Linnik, Yevgeny Prigozhin, Dmitry Mazepin, and Alexei Mordashov.In April 2022, Sweeney stopped tracking Mark Cuban\\'s travel in exchange for his friendship and business advice.In May 2023 Sweeney began tracking the flights of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis after DeSantis signed a bill into law redacting details of his trips he made as Governor.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal threats from Elon Musk ===\\nIn November 2021, Musk cited security concerns and requested that Sweeney stop tracking his private Gulfstream jet in exchange for $5,000. Sweeney responded that he might stop tracking Musk\\'s private jet in exchange for an internship, US$50,000, or a Tesla Model 3. In November 2022, after Musk bought Twitter, Musk said, \"My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk\". On December 14, 2022, Twitter suspended Sweeney\\'s airplane-tracking accounts for Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Russian oligarchs, as well as Sweeney\\'s personal Twitter account. Sweeney reacted to the suspension, stating: \"I mean, this looks horrible. He literally said he was keeping my account up for free speech\". On December 15, a number of high-profile journalists were banned after covering Twitter\\'s removal of the ElonJet account.Musk announced that he would be taking legal action against Sweeney. In relation to the legal action, Musk alleged that in Los Angeles, a car carrying his 2-year-old son was followed by a \"crazy stalker\" who thought Musk was inside, \"blocked [the] car from moving\" and \"climbed onto [the] hood.\" A Los Angeles Police detective in the stalking investigations unit said they had no evidence indicating that the alleged stalker had used ElonJet.
